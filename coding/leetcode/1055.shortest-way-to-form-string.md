# Shortest Way to Form String
[1055. Shortest Way to Form String](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-way-to-form-string/)

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

# Key insights
- Greedily matches characters of target as a subsequence of source, counting how many passes through source are needed
- Each pass through source advances the target pointer for every matched character
- If a full pass through source makes no progress on target, the target cannot be formed (return -1)

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} source
 * @param {string} target
 * @return {number}
 */
var shortestWay = function(source, target) {
    let pTarget = 0;
    let count = 0;
    while (pTarget < target.length) {
        let pSource = 0;
        const lastPTarget = pTarget;
        while (pSource < source.length && pTarget < target.length) {
            if (source[pSource] === target[pTarget]) pTarget++;
            pSource++;
        }
        if (lastPTarget === pTarget) return -1; // not moving
        count++;
    }
    return count;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(m * n) -- where m is the length of target and n is the length of source (at most m passes through source)
**Space:** O(1) -- only pointer variables
