# Boats to Save People
[881. Boats to Save People](https://leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people/)

You are given an array people where people[i] is the weight of the ith person, and an infinite number of boats where each boat can carry a maximum weight of limit. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most limit.

# Key insights
- Sort people by weight
- Two pointers: try to pair lightest (left) with heaviest (right) person
- If their sum exceeds limit, heaviest person goes alone
- If sum is within limit, both can share a boat

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} people
 * @param {number} limit
 * @return {number}
 */
var numRescueBoats = function(people, limit) {
    people.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let count = 0, l = 0, r = people.length - 1;
    while (l <= r) {
        const sum = people[l] + people[r];
        if (sum > limit) {
            count++;
            r--;
        } else {
            count++;
            l++;
            r--;
        }
    }
    return count;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n log n) - dominated by sorting
**Space:** O(1) - only using pointers (or O(log n) for sorting)
