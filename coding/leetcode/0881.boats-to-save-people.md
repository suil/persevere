 * @param {number[]} people
 * @param {number} limit
 * @return {number}
 */
var numRescueBoats = function(people, limit) {
    people.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let count = 0, l = 0, r = people.length - 1;
    while (l <= r) {
        const sum = people[l] + people[r];
        if (sum > limit) {
            count++;
            r--;
        } else {
            count++;
            l++;
            r--;
        }
