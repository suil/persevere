# Simplify Path
[71. Simplify Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/)

You are given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which always begins with a slash '/'. Your task is to transform this absolute path into its simplified canonical path.

# Key insights
- Split the path by '/' and use a stack to process each segment
- Skip empty segments and '.'; pop from stack on '..'; push valid directory names
- Join the stack with '/' and prepend '/' for the canonical path

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} path
 * @return {string}
 */
var simplifyPath = function(path) {
    const segments = path.split('/');
    const stack = [];

    for (let segment of segments) {
        if (segment === '' || segment === '.') continue;
        if (segment === '..') {
            stack.pop();
        } else {
            stack.push(segment);
        }
    }
    return '/' + stack.join('/');
};
```
