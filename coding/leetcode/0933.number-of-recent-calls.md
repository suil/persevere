# Number of Recent Calls
[933. Number of Recent Calls](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-recent-calls/)

You have a RecentCounter class which counts the number of recent requests within a certain time frame.

# Key insights
- Use a queue to store ping timestamps
- On each ping, remove timestamps older than t - 3000 from the front
- Return the queue size as the count of recent calls
- Since timestamps are strictly increasing, old pings will always be at the front

# Code
```javascript

var RecentCounter = function() {
    this.pings = [];
};

/** 
 * @param {number} t
 * @return {number}
 */
RecentCounter.prototype.ping = function(t) {
    this.pings.push(t);
    
    while (this.pings[0] < t - 3000) {
        this.pings.shift();
    }

    return this.pings.length;
};

/** 
 * Your RecentCounter object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * var obj = new RecentCounter()
 * var param_1 = obj.ping(t)
 */
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(1) amortized per ping - each timestamp is added and removed at most once
**Space:** O(w) - where w is the number of pings in the 3000ms window
