# Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram
[1347. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-steps-to-make-two-strings-anagram/)

You are given two strings of the same length s and t. In one step you can choose any character of t and replace it with another character.

# Key insights
- Builds a frequency difference map: increments for characters in s, decrements for characters in t
- The sum of all positive values in the map gives the number of replacements needed (characters in s that are excess)
- Each positive count represents a character that needs to be replaced in t to match s

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} t
 * @return {number}
 */
var minSteps = function(s, t) {
    if (s.length !== t.length) return 0;

    const freqMap = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        const sChar = s[i];
        const tChar = t[i];
        freqMap.set(sChar, (freqMap.get(sChar) || 0) + 1);
        freqMap.set(tChar, (freqMap.get(tChar) || 0) - 1);
    }

    console.log(freqMap)
    let totalSteps = 0;
    for (const [key, count] of freqMap) {
        totalSteps += count > 0 ? count : 0;
    }

    return totalSteps;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) -- single pass through both strings simultaneously
**Space:** O(1) -- the frequency map is bounded by 26 lowercase letters
