# All Paths From Source to Target
[797. All Paths From Source to Target](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-paths-from-source-to-target/)

Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, find all possible paths from node 0 to node n - 1 and return them in any order.

# Key insights
- DFS/backtracking from node 0, collecting paths that reach node n-1
- Since the graph is a DAG, no cycle detection or visited set is needed
- Each path is copied when reaching the target to avoid mutation issues

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} graph
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var allPathsSourceTarget = function(graph) {
    function dfs(current, paths, output) {
        if (current === graph.length - 1) {
            output.push([...paths])
            return;
        }

        const connectedNodes = graph[current];
        for (const node of connectedNodes) {
            const next = node;
            const nextPaths = [...paths, node];
            dfs(next, nextPaths, output);
        }
    }

    const output = [];
    dfs(0, [0], output);
    return output;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(2^n * n) in the worst case for the number of paths times path length
**Space:** O(2^n * n) for storing all paths
