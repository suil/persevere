# Friends Of Appropriate Ages
[825. Friends Of Appropriate Ages](https://leetcode.com/problems/friends-of-appropriate-ages/)

Some people will make friend requests. The list of their ages is given and ages[i] is the age of the ith person. 

Person A will NOT friend request person B (B != A) if any of the following conditions are true:

age[B] <= 0.5 * age[A] + 7
age[B] > age[A]
age[B] > 100 && age[A] < 100
Otherwise, A will friend request B.

Note that if A requests B, B does not necessarily request A.  Also, people will not friend request themselves.

How many total friend requests are made?

Example 1:

Input: [16,16]
Output: 2
Explanation: 2 people friend request each other.
Example 2:

Input: [16,17,18]
Output: 2
Explanation: Friend requests are made 17 -> 16, 18 -> 17.
Example 3:

Input: [20,30,100,110,120]
Output: 3
Explanation: Friend requests are made 110 -> 100, 120 -> 110, 120 -> 100.

# Key insights
* Use counting array to group people by age instead of processing each person individually
* Build prefix sum array to efficiently calculate valid age ranges for friend requests
* Mathematical formula avoids nested loops: base * count + count * (count-1) for same ages
* Skip ages below 15 since they cannot send requests due to constraint x > 0.5*y + 7

# Code
```javascript
var numFriendRequests = function(ages) {
    const counts = Array(121).fill(0);
    const accum = Array(121).fill(0);
    
    for (const age of ages) { ++counts[age]; }
    for (let i = 1; i <= 120; ++i) {
        accum[i] = accum[i - 1] + counts[i];
    }
    let ans = 0;
    for (let i = 15; i <= 120; ++i) {
        const base = accum[i - 1] - accum[Math.floor(i / 2 + 7)];
        ans += base * counts[i] + counts[i] * (counts[i] - 1);
    }
    return ans;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - One pass through input array to count ages, then fixed iterations over age range 1-120, making it linear in input size
**Space:** O(1) - Uses two fixed-size arrays of length 121 regardless of input size
