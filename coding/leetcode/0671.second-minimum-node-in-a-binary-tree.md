# Second Minimum Node In a Binary Tree
[671. Second Minimum Node In a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/second-minimum-node-in-a-binary-tree/)

Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with the non-negative value, where each node in this tree has exactly two or zero sub-node. If the node has two sub-nodes, then this node's value is the smaller value among its two sub-nodes. More formally, the property root.val = min(root.left.val, root.right.val) always holds.

Given such a binary tree, you need to output the second minimum value in the set made of all the nodes' value in the whole tree.

If no such second minimum value exists, output -1 instead.

Example 1:
        2
      /   \
     2     5
          / \
         5   7
Input: root = [2,2,5,null,null,5,7]
Output: 5
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, the second smallest value is 5.

Example 2:
        2
      /   \
     2     2
Input: root = [2,2,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, but there isn't any second smallest value.

# Key insights
* Leverages tree property: parent always equals minimum of children
* Recursive DFS to explore subtrees when child equals parent (minimum)
* Prunes search by stopping at nodes larger than current minimum
* Returns first valid second minimum found through tree traversal

# Code
```javascript
var findSecondMinimumValue = function(root) {
    if (!root) {
        return -1;
    }
    if (!root.left && !root.right) {
        return -1;
    }
    
    const leftSecMin = 
        root.left.val === root.val
        ? findSecondMinimumValue(root.left)
        : root.left.val;

    const rightSecMin = 
        root.right.val === root.val
        ? findSecondMinimumValue(root.right)
        : root.right.val;

    if (leftSecMin != -1 && rightSecMin != -1) {
        return Math.min(leftSecMin, rightSecMin);
    }
    
    if (leftSecMin != -1) {
        return leftSecMin;
    }
    if (rightSecMin != -1) {
        return rightSecMin;
    }
    
    return -1;
};
