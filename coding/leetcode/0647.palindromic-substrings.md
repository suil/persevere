# Palindromic Substrings
[647. Palindromic Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/)

Given a string s, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.

A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".

Example 2:
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".

# Key insights
* Expand around centers technique: check palindromes by expanding outward from each possible center
* Two cases per position: odd-length palindromes (center at i) and even-length palindromes (center between i and i+1)
* Two pointers moving outward while characters match, counting valid palindromic substrings
* O(n²) time complexity with O(1) space - efficient compared to O(n³) brute force approach

# Code
```javascript
var countSubstrings = function(s) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        count += countSubstringsHelper(s, i, i);
        count += countSubstringsHelper(s, i, i + 1);
    }
    return count;
    
};
function countSubstringsHelper(s, low, high) {
    let count = 0;
    while (low >= 0 && high <= s.length - 1) {
        if (s[low] !== s[high]) { break; }
        count++;
        low--;
        high++;
    }
    return count;
}
