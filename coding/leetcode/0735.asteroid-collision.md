# Asteroid Collision
[735. Asteroid Collision](https://leetcode.com/problems/asteroid-collision/)

We are given an array asteroids of integers representing asteroids in a row. The absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive = right, negative = left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions.

# Key insights
* Only a collision occurs when a positive asteroid is followed by a negative one (moving toward each other)
* Use a stack to simulate collisions
* For each negative asteroid, pop positive asteroids from the stack if they are smaller
* If equal size, both are destroyed; if the positive is larger, the negative is destroyed

# Code
```javascript
var asteroidCollision = function(asteroids) {
    const stack = [];
    
    for (const asteroid of asteroids) {
        let massLeft = asteroid;

        while (stack.length > 0 && stack.at(-1) > 0 && massLeft < 0) {
            const last = stack.pop();
            const curr = asteroid;
            const lastMass = Math.abs(last);
            const currMass = Math.abs(curr);

            if (lastMass === currMass) {
                massLeft = 0;
            } else if (lastMass > currMass) {
                massLeft = last;
            } else if (lastMass < currMass) {
                massLeft = curr;
            }
        }

        if (massLeft !== 0) stack.push(massLeft);
    }

    return stack;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - Each asteroid is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.**Space:** O(n) - The stack can hold up to n asteroids.
