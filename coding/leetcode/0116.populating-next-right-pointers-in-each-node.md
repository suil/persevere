# Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node
[116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node/)

You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:

# Key insights
- BFS level-order traversal using a queue; connect each node's next to the next node in the same level
- Track a `prev` pointer within each level to link nodes left-to-right
- Process level by level, building the next level's queue from children

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * // Definition for a _Node.
 * function _Node(val, left, right, next) {
 *    this.val = val === undefined ? null : val;
 *    this.left = left === undefined ? null : left;
 *    this.right = right === undefined ? null : right;
 *    this.next = next === undefined ? null : next;
 * };
 */

/**
 * @param {_Node} root
 * @return {_Node}
 */
var connect = function(root) {
    if (root === null) return null;

    let queue = [root];

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const nextQueue = [];
        let prev = null;

        for (const node of queue) {
            if (prev !== null) prev.next = node;
            prev = node;
            if (node.left) nextQueue.push(node.left);
            if (node.right) nextQueue.push(node.right);
        }
        queue = nextQueue;
    }
    return root;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n)
**Space:** O(n) for the queue (up to n/2 nodes at the widest level)
