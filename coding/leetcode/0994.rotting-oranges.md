# Rotting Oranges
[994. Rotting Oranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/)

You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:
- 0 representing an empty cell,
- 1 representing a fresh orange, or
- 2 representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner is never reached.
Example 3:

Input: grid = [[0,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since there are no fresh oranges, the answer is 0.

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 10
grid[i][j] is 0, 1, or 2.

# Key insights

- **Multi-source BFS**: start BFS from all rotten oranges simultaneously — each BFS level represents one minute
- Scan the grid first to enqueue all initially rotten oranges and count fresh oranges
- Each minute, process the entire current queue level: rot all adjacent fresh oranges, decrement the fresh count, and enqueue them
- After BFS completes, if `fresh > 0` some oranges are unreachable — return `-1`
- If there are no fresh oranges from the start, return `0`

# Code
```javascript
var orangesRotting = function(grid) {
    const rowLen = grid.length;
    const colLen = grid[0].length;
    
    const queue = [];
    let fresh = 0;
    
    // Find all initially rotten oranges and count fresh ones
    for (let row = 0; row < rowLen; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col < colLen; col++) {
            if (grid[row][col] === 2) {
                queue.push([row, col, 0]);
            } else if (grid[row][col] === 1) {
                fresh++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (fresh === 0) return 0;
    
    const directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]];
    let minutes = 0;
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const [row, col, step] = queue.shift();
        minutes = Math.max(minutes, step);
        
        for (const [dr, dc] of directions) {
            const newRow = row + dr;
            const newCol = col + dc;
            
            // Check bounds and if it's a fresh orange
            if (newRow >= 0 && newRow < rowLen && newCol >= 0 && newCol < colLen && grid[newRow][newCol] === 1) {
                grid[newRow][newCol] = 2;  // Mark as rotten
                fresh--;
                queue.push([newRow, newCol, step + 1]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return fresh === 0 ? minutes : -1;
};
```
# Complexity

- **Time**: O(m * n) — each cell is visited at most once during BFS
- **Space**: O(m * n) — the queue can hold at most all cells in the grid
