# Odd Even Linked List
[328. Odd Even Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/)

Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.

# Key insights
- Maintain two pointers: one for odd-indexed nodes, one for even-indexed nodes
- Save the head of the even list to connect later
- Traverse once, relinking odd nodes together and even nodes together
- Finally, connect the end of the odd list to the head of the even list

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val, next) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
var oddEvenList = function(head) {
    if (head == null) {
        return head;
    }
    let odd = head, even = head.next, evenHead = even;
    while (even != null && even.next != null) {
        odd.next = odd.next.next;
        odd = odd.next;
        even.next = even.next.next;
        even = even.next;
    }
    odd.next = evenHead;
    return head;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - single pass through the list
**Space:** O(1) - only using a few pointers
