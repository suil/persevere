# Robot Bounded In Circle
[1041. Robot Bounded In Circle](https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-bounded-in-circle/)

On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north. Note that:

# Key insights
- After one execution of instructions, the robot is bounded in a circle if it returns to the origin OR its direction has changed
- If the robot faces a different direction after one cycle, it will return to origin after at most 4 cycles
- Direction is tracked as an index into a 4-direction array, with L/R modifying the index by +3/+1 mod 4

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} instructions
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isRobotBounded = function(instructions) {
    const dirs = [[-1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [0, -1]]; // N, E, S, W (grid style)
    let row = 0, col = 0, dir = 0;

    for (let ch of instructions) {
        if (ch === 'G') {
            row += dirs[dir][0];
            col += dirs[dir][1];
        } else if (ch === 'L') {
            dir = (dir + 3) % 4;
        } else if (ch === 'R') {
            dir = (dir + 1) % 4;
        }
    }

    return (row === 0 && col === 0) || dir !== 0;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) -- where n is the length of the instructions string
**Space:** O(1) -- only tracking position and direction
