# Reverse Words in a String
[151. Reverse Words in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/)

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

Example 1:
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"

Example 2:
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

Example 3:
Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

Example 4:
Input: s = "  Bob    Loves  Alice   "
Output: "Alice Loves Bob"

Example 5:
Input: s = "Alice does not even like bob"
Output: "bob like even not does Alice"

# Key insights
* Split string into words and filter out empty strings from extra spaces
* Use two-pointer technique to reverse array of words in-place
* Join reversed word array back into single string with spaces
* O(n) time complexity with O(n) space for creating word array

# Code
```javascript
var reverseWords = function(s) {
    const newS = s.split(' ').filter(c => !!c);
    let left = 0, right = newS.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        const t = newS[left];
        newS[left] = newS[right];
        newS[right] = t;
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return newS.join(' ');
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - where n is the length of the input string, as we need to split the string, filter empty strings, reverse the array, and join back to string
**Space:** O(n) - we create a new array to store the filtered words and the final joined string
