# Arithmetic Slices
[413. Arithmetic Slices](https://leetcode.com/problems/arithmetic-slices)

An integer array is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

For example, [1,3,5,7,9], [7,7,7,7], and [3,-1,-5,-9] are arithmetic sequences.
Given an integer array nums, return the number of arithmetic subarrays of nums.

A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: We have 3 arithmetic slices in nums: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1,2,3,4] itself.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 0

# Key insights
* Dynamic programming builds solution by extending previous arithmetic sequences
* Check consecutive differences to identify arithmetic progression patterns
* dp[i] stores count of arithmetic slices ending at index i
* Single pass with O(n) time complexity using incremental counting

# Code
```javascript
var numberOfArithmeticSlices = function(nums) {
    const dp = [...Array(nums.length)].fill(0);
    
    let total = 0;
    for (let i = 2; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] - nums[i - 1] === nums[i - 1] - nums[i - 2]) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1;
            total += dp[i];
        }
    }
    return total;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - Single pass through the array starting from index 2, performing constant time operations at each step.
**Space:** O(n) - Creates a dp array of the same length as the input array to store intermediate results.
