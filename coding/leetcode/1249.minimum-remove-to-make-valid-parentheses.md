# Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses
[1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-remove-to-make-valid-parentheses/)

Given a string s of `(`, `)` and lowercase English characters.

Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses (either `(` or `)`) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid and return any valid string.

A parentheses string is valid if and only if:
- It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or
- It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
- It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.

# Key insights
* Use a stack to track indices of unmatched `(` parentheses
* On `)`, if the stack is empty it's unmatched — mark it for removal; otherwise pop the stack (it matched)
* After the pass, any indices remaining in the stack are unmatched `(` — also mark for removal
* Use a set of indices to remove for O(1) lookup when building the result

# Code
```javascript
var minRemoveToMakeValid = function(s) {
    const stack = [];
    s = s.split('');

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] === '(') {
            stack.push(i);
        } else if (s[i] === ')') {
            if (stack.length > 0) {
                stack.pop();
            } else {
                s[i] = '';
            }
        }
    }

    stack.forEach(idx => s[idx] = '');
    return s.join('');
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - Single pass to identify invalid parentheses and one pass to build the result string.

**Space:** O(n) - The stack and set together can hold at most n indices in the worst case.
