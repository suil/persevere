# K Closest Points to Origin
[973. K Closest Points to Origin](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/)

Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

# Key insights
- Use a max-heap of size k to maintain the k closest points; evict the farthest point whenever the heap exceeds size k
- Distance comparison uses squared Euclidean distance (x^2 + y^2), avoiding unnecessary square root computation
- After processing all points, the heap contains exactly the k closest points

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} points
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var kClosest = function(points, k) {
    const pq = new MaxPriorityQueue(p => p[0] ** 2 + p[1] ** 2);

    for (const p of points) {
        pq.enqueue(p);
        if (pq.size() > k) pq.dequeue();
    }
    return pq.toArray();
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n log k) -- each of n points is enqueued/dequeued from a heap of size k
**Space:** O(k) -- the max-heap stores at most k points
