### Sum Root to Leaf Numbers
[129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/)

```html
You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.
Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

A leaf node is a node with no children.

Example 1:
    1
   / \
  2   3
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.

Example 2:
      4
    /   \
   9     0
  / \
 5   1

Input: root = [4,9,0,5,1]
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
```

```javascript
var sumNumbers = function(root) {
    const output = [];
    sumNumbersHelper(root, [], output);
    return output.reduce((memo, number) => memo + Number(number), 0);
};
function sumNumbersHelper(node, number, output) {
    const nextNumber = `${number}${node.val}`;
    if (node.left === null || node.right === null) {
        output.push(nextNumber);
        return;
    }
    sumNumbersHelper(node.left, nextNumber, output);
    sumNumbersHelper(node.right, nextNumber, output);
}
```
