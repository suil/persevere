# Reverse Substrings Between Each Pair of Parentheses
[1190. Reverse Substrings Between Each Pair of Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-substrings-between-each-pair-of-parentheses/)

You are given a string s that consists of lower case English letters and brackets.

Reverse the strings in each pair of matching parentheses, starting from the innermost one.

Your result should not contain any brackets.

# Key insights
* Use a stack to save the string built so far, and a `currStr` variable for the current nesting level
* On `(`, push `currStr` onto the stack and reset it — saving progress before entering a deeper level
* On `)`, pop the last saved string and prepend it to the reversed `currStr`
* On a regular character, append it to `currStr`
* After processing all characters, `currStr` holds the final result

# Code
```javascript
var reverseParentheses = function(s) {
    const stack = [];
    let currStr = '';
    for (const char of s) {
        if (char === '(') {
            stack.push(currStr);
            currStr = '';
        } else if (char === ')') {
            const lastStr = stack.pop();
            currStr = lastStr + currStr.split('').reverse().join('');
        } else {
            currStr += char;
        }
    }
    return currStr;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n^2) - Each character may be reversed multiple times due to nested parentheses, leading to quadratic time in the worst case.
**Space:** O(n) - The stack and intermediate strings together use space proportional to the length of the input.
