# Two Sum Less Than K
[1099. Two Sum Less Than K](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-less-than-k/)

Given an array nums of integers and integer k, return the maximum sum such that
there exists i &lt; j with nums[i] + nums[j] = sum and sum &lt; k. If no i, j exist
satisfying this equation, return -1. 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [34,23,1,24,75,33,54,8], k = 60 

Output: 58 Explanation: We can use 34 and 24 to
sum 58 which is less than 60. 

Example 2:
Input: nums = [10,20,30], k = 15
Output: -1 Explanation: In this case it is not possible to get a pair sum less
that 15.

# Key insights
* Sort array first to enable two-pointer technique
* Use two pointers from ends, move based on sum comparison to k
* Track maximum valid sum while avoiding sums >= k
* O(n log n) sorting dominates O(n) two-pointer traversal complexity

# Code
```javascript
var twoSumLessThanK = function (nums, k) {
  let i = 0;
  let j = nums.length - 1;
  let finalSum = -1;
  nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  while (i < j) {
    const sum = nums[i] + nums[j];
    if (sum >= k) {
      j--;
    } else {
      finalSum = Math.max(finalSum, sum);
      i++;
    }
  }

  return finalSum;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n log n) - dominated by the sorting step, while the two-pointer traversal is O(n)
**Space:** O(1) - only uses constant extra space for variables, sorting is done in-place
