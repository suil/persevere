# Assign Cookies
[455. Assign Cookies](https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/)

Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

# Key insights
- Sort both arrays in descending order (greediest children and largest cookies first)
- Greedy: try to satisfy each child with the largest available cookie
- If a cookie satisfies a child, move to next cookie; always move to next child
- This maximizes the number of satisfied children

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} g
 * @param {number[]} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var findContentChildren = function(g, s) {
    g.sort((a, b) => b - a);
    s.sort((a, b) => b - a);

    let count = 0;
    let si = 0;
    for (let gi = 0; gi < g.length; gi++) {
        if (s[si] >= g[gi]) {
            count++;
            si++;
        }
    }
    return count;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n log n + m log m) - sorting both arrays
**Space:** O(1) - only using pointers (or O(log n) for sorting)
