# Counting Elements
[1426. Counting Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-elements/)

Given an integer array arr, count how many elements x there are, such that x + 1 is also in arr. If there are duplicates in arr, count them separately.

# Key insights
- Stores all elements in a Set for O(1) lookup
- For each element x, checks if x + 1 exists in the set and counts it if so
- Duplicates are counted separately since we iterate the original array, not the set

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @return {number}
 */
var countElements = function(arr) {
    const set = new Set(arr);
    let count = 0;
    for (let x of arr) {
        if (set.has(x + 1)) count++;
    }
    return count;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) -- one pass to build the set, one pass to count
**Space:** O(n) -- for the set
