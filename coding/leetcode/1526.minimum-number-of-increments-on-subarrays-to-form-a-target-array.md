# Minimum Number of Increments on Subarrays to Form a Target Array
[1526. Minimum Number of Increments on Subarrays to Form a Target Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-increments-on-subarrays-to-form-a-target-array/)

You are given an integer array target. You have an integer array initial of the same size as target, initially filled with zeros.

In one operation you can choose any subarray from initial and increment each value by one.

Return the minimum number of operations to form a target array from initial.

# Key insights
* Each time the target value increases compared to the previous element, we need additional operations equal to the difference
* If the target value decreases or stays the same, no new operations are needed — existing ones simply stop
* The first element always requires `target[0]` operations since we start from zero
* This is equivalent to summing all positive differences between consecutive elements

# Code
```javascript
var minNumberOperations = function(target) {
    let ops = target[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < target.length; i++) {
        if (target[i] > target[i - 1]) {
            ops += target[i] - target[i - 1];
        }
    }
    return ops;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - Single pass through the array comparing adjacent elements.
**Space:** O(1) - Only a constant amount of extra space is used for the running total.
