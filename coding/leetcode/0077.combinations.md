### Combinations
[77. Combinations](https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/description/)

```html
Given two integers n and k, return all possible combinations of k numbers chosen from the range [1, n].

You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: n = 4, k = 2
Output: [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]
Explanation: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 total combinations.
Note that combinations are unordered, i.e., [1,2] and [2,1] are considered to be the same combination.

Example 2:

Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: [[1]]
Explanation: There is 1 choose 1 = 1 total combination.
```

```javascript
var combine = function(n, k) {
    const output = [];
    combineHelper(n, k, 1, [], output);
    return output;
};

function combineHelper(n, k, current, combinations, output) {
    if (current > n || combinations.length === k) {
        if (combinations.length === k) {
            output.push([...combinations]);
        }
        return;
    }
    
    for (let i = current; i <= n; i++) {
        const nextCurrent = i + 1;
        const nextCombinations = [...combinations, i];
        combineHelper(n, k, nextCurrent, nextCombinations, output);
    }
}
