# Set Mismatch
[645. Set Mismatch](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-mismatch/description/)

You have a set of integers s, which originally contains all the numbers from 1 to n. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in s got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.

You are given an integer array nums representing the data status of this set after the error.

Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return them in the form of an array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]
Output: [2,3]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: [1,2]

# Key insights
* Use hash map to count frequency of each number for O(1) lookup
* Two-pass approach: first pass builds frequency map, second validates range 1 to n
* Find duplicate by checking which number has frequency of 2
* Find missing by checking which number in range [1,n] is absent from map

# Code
```javascript
var findErrorNums = function(nums) {
    const map = new Map();
    let dup = -1, missing = 1;
    for (const n of nums) {
        map.set(n, (map.get(n) || 0) + 1);
    }
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= nums.length; i++) {
        if (map.has(i)) {
            if (map.get(i) == 2) {
                dup = i;
            }
        }
        else {
            missing = i;
        }
    }
    return [dup, missing];
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - First loop iterates through all n elements to build the map, second loop iterates through numbers 1 to n to find duplicate and missing
**Space:** O(n) - Map stores at most n key-value pairs for the input array elements
