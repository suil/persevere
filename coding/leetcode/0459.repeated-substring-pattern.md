# Repeated Substring Pattern
[459. Repeated Substring Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-substring-pattern/)

Given a string s, check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together.

# Key insights
- Try every possible substring length from 1 to len/2; if the string length is divisible by the pattern length, repeat the pattern and compare
- Only substrings starting from index 0 need to be considered since the repeated pattern must begin at the start
- Early return on the first match avoids unnecessary work

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var repeatedSubstringPattern = function(s) {
    let pattern = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < Math.floor(s.length / 2); i++) {
        pattern += s[i];
        const str = pattern.repeat(s.length / pattern.length);
        if (str === s) return true;
    }
    return false;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n * sqrt(n)) -- for each candidate length up to n/2, string repeat and comparison take O(n)
**Space:** O(n) -- for the repeated string created during comparison
