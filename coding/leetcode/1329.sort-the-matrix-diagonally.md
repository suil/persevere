# Sort the Matrix Diagonally
[1329. Sort the Matrix Diagonally](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-the-matrix-diagonally/)

A matrix diagonal is a diagonal line of cells starting from some cell in either the topmost row or leftmost column and going in the bottom-right direction until reaching the matrix's end. For example, the matrix diagonal starting from mat[2][0], where mat is a 6 x 3 matrix, includes cells mat[2][0], mat[3][1], and mat[4][2].

# Key insights
- Groups elements by their diagonal using the key (i - j); cells on the same diagonal share the same difference
- Sorts each diagonal's elements independently
- Places sorted elements back into the matrix by shifting from each diagonal's sorted list

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} mat
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var diagonalSort = function(mat) {
    const m = mat.length;
    const n = mat[0].length;
    const diagonals = new Map();

    // Store elements of each diagonal in a list
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            const diagonalKey = i - j;
            if (!diagonals.has(diagonalKey)) {
                diagonals.set(diagonalKey, []);
            }
            diagonals.get(diagonalKey).push(mat[i][j]);
        }
    }

    // Sort the elements of each diagonal
    for (const diagonalKey of diagonals.keys()) {
        diagonals.get(diagonalKey).sort((a, b) => a - b);
    }

    // Place the sorted elements back into the matrix
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            const diagonalKey = i - j;
            mat[i][j] = diagonals.get(diagonalKey).shift();
        }
    }

    return mat;
};

```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(m * n * log(min(m, n))) -- sorting each diagonal of length up to min(m, n)
**Space:** O(m * n) -- for storing all diagonal elements
