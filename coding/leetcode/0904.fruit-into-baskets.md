        while (basket.size > 2) {
            basket.set(fruits[left], basket.get(fruits[left]) - 1);
            if (basket.get(fruits[left]) === 0) {

            }
            left++;
        }
        if (basket.size > 0) max = Math.max(max, i - left + 1)
    }

    return max === -Infinity ? 0 : max;
