# Jump Game III
[1306. Jump Game III](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-iii/)

Given an array of non-negative integers arr, you are initially positioned at start index of the array. When you are at index i, you can jump to i + arr[i] or i - arr[i], check if you can reach any index with value 0.

# Key insights
- DFS with a visited set to explore reachable indices by jumping +arr[i] or -arr[i] from each position
- Returns true as soon as an index with value 0 is found
- The visited set prevents infinite loops from cycles in the jump graph

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @param {number} start
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var canReach = function(arr, start) {
    
    function backtrack(index, visited = new Set()) {
        if (index > arr.length || index < 0) return false;
        if (visited.has(index)) return false;
        if (arr[index] === 0) return true;

        visited.add(index);
        
        return backtrack(index + arr[index], visited) || backtrack(index - arr[index], visited);
    }

    return backtrack(start);
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) -- each index is visited at most once
**Space:** O(n) -- for the visited set and recursion stack
