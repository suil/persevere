# Single Element in a Sorted Array
[540. Single Element in a Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-element-in-a-sorted-array/)

You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.

Return the single element that appears only once. Your solution must run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

# Key insights
* Binary search on even indices — before the single element, pairs start at even indices
* If `nums[mid] === nums[mid + 1]` (mid is even), the single element is to the right
* If `nums[mid] !== nums[mid + 1]` (mid is even), the single element is at mid or to the left
* Ensure mid is always even by adjusting: `mid = mid & ~1`

# Code
```javascript
var singleNonDuplicate = function(nums) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (mid % 2 === 1) mid--;

        if (nums[mid] === nums[mid + 1]) { // aligned on the left
            left = mid + 2;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return nums[left];
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(log n) - Binary search halving the search space each iteration.

**Space:** O(1) - Only constant extra space is used.
