# Count and Say
[38. Count and Say](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/)

The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

# Key insights
- Recursively compute the (n-1)th term, then "read" it by counting consecutive identical digits
- Use a while loop with an inner while loop to group runs of the same digit and append "count + digit" to the result

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {string}
 */
var countAndSay = function(n) {
    if (n === 1) return '1';

    const prev = countAndSay(n - 1);

    let i = 0;
    let res = '';
    while (i < prev.length) {
        let count = 1;
        while (i + 1 < prev.length && prev[i] === prev[i + 1]) {
            count++;
            i++;
        }
        res += `${count}${prev[i]}`;
        i++;
    }
    return res;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n * L) where L is the length of the resulting string at each level**Space:** O(L) for the recursion stack and intermediate strings
