# Ugly Number II
[264. Ugly Number II](https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number-ii)

An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return the nth ugly number.

Example 1:

Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

# Key insights
* Dynamic programming with three pointers to track multiples of 2, 3, and 5
* Always select minimum of next candidates to maintain sorted order
* Move pointers forward when their multiple is chosen to avoid duplicates
* Build solution incrementally using previously computed ugly numbers

# Code
```javascript
var nthUglyNumber = function(n) {
    var dp = new Array(n)
    dp[0] = 1

    let p1 = 0, p2 = 0, p3 = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        let next1 = dp[p1] * 2
        let next2 = dp[p2] * 3
        let next3 = dp[p3] * 5

        dp[i] = Math.min(next1, next2, next3)

        if (dp[i] == next1) p1++
        if (dp[i] == next2) p2++
        if (dp[i] == next3) p3++
    }
    return dp[n - 1]
};
