# Kth Missing Positive Number
[1539. Kth Missing Positive Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-missing-positive-number/)

Given an array arr of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer k.

Return the kth positive integer that is missing from this array.

# Key insights
* Binary search on the array to find where the kth missing number falls
* The number of missing positives before index `mid` is `arr[mid] - (mid + 1)`
* Binary search for the smallest index where the count of missing numbers >= k
* The answer is `k + left`, where `left` is the insertion point after binary search

# Code
```javascript
var findKthPositive = function(arr, k) {
    let left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
    let leftPos = undefined;
    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        const missing = arr[mid] - 1 - mid; // arr[mid] - 1: pos it's supposed to be. mid: curr pos
        if (missing < k) {
            leftPos = mid;
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    if (leftPos === undefined) return k;
    return arr[leftPos] + k - (arr[leftPos] - 1 - leftPos);
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(log n) - Binary search over the array to find the position where the kth missing number falls.

**Space:** O(1) - Only a constant amount of extra space is used for pointers.
