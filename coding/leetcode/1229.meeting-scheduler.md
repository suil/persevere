# Meeting Scheduler
[1229. Meeting Scheduler](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-scheduler/)

Given the availability time slots arrays slots1 and slots2 of two people and a meeting duration duration, return the earliest time slot that works for both of them and is of duration duration.

# Key insights
- Sorts both slot arrays by start time, then uses two pointers to find overlapping intervals
- Computes overlap as [max(starts), min(ends)] and checks if it meets the required duration
- Advances the pointer whose slot ends first, as it cannot overlap with future slots of the other person

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} slots1
 * @param {number[][]} slots2
 * @param {number} duration
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var minAvailableDuration = function(slots1, slots2, duration) {
    slots1.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
    slots2.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

    let p1 = 0;
    let p2 = 0;

    while (p1 < slots1.length && p2 < slots2.length) {
        const intersectLeft = Math.max(slots1[p1][0], slots2[p2][0]);
        const intersectRight = Math.min(slots1[p1][1], slots2[p2][1]);
        const overlappedDuration = intersectRight - intersectLeft;
        if (overlappedDuration >= duration) {
            return [intersectLeft, intersectLeft + duration];
        }
        // no available duration
        if (slots1[p1][1] > slots2[p2][1]) {
            p2++;
        } else {
            p1++;
        }
    }

    return [];
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(m log m + n log n) -- dominated by sorting both slot arrays
**Space:** O(1) -- excluding sort space, only pointer variables
