# First Unique Character in a String
[387. First Unique Character in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/)

Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.

# Key insights
- Map each character to its list of indices
- Characters appearing exactly once are unique
- Among all unique characters, find the one with the smallest index

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var firstUniqChar = function(s) {
    const map = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        const char = s[i];
        if (!map.has(char)) map.set(char, []);
        map.get(char).push(i);
    }
    
    let earliestIndex = Infinity;
    for (const [char, indexes] of map) {
        if (indexes.length === 1) {
            earliestIndex = Math.min(earliestIndex, indexes[0]);
        }
    }
    return earliestIndex === Infinity ? -1 : earliestIndex;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - two passes: one to build map, one to find minimum
**Space:** O(1) - map has at most 26 entries for lowercase letters
