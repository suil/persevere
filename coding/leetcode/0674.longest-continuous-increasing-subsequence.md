# Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence
[674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence/)

Greedy:

# Key insights
* Single pass through array with greedy approach
* Reset counter when sequence breaks, track maximum length seen
* O(1) space complexity using only two variables for current and max count
* Compare adjacent elements to detect continuous increasing pattern

# Code
```javascript
var findLengthOfLCIS = function(nums) {
    let count = 1;
    let max = 1;
    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
            count++;
            max = Math.max(max, count);
        } else {
            count = 1;
        }
    }
    return max;
};
