# Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero
[1611. Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-one-bit-operations-to-make-integers-zero/)

Given an integer n, you must transform it into 0 using the following operations any number of times:
- Change the rightmost (0th) bit in the binary representation of n.
- Change the ith bit in the binary representation of n if the (i-1)th bit is set to 1 and the (i-2)th through 0th bits are set to 0.

Return the minimum number of operations to transform n into 0.

# Key insights
* This problem maps to Gray code — the answer is the Gray code inverse (converting from Gray code to binary)
* To convert Gray code to binary: XOR the number with all right-shifted versions of itself
* Alternatively, use the recursive relation: to zero out the highest set bit at position k, it takes `2^(k+1) - 1` operations, minus the cost to handle the remaining bits
* Each highest bit alternates between adding and subtracting cost

# Code
```javascript
var minimumOneBitOperations = function(n) {
    let result = 0;
    while (n > 0) {
        result ^= n;
        n >>= 1;
    }
    return result;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(log n) - Iterates once per bit in the binary representation of n.

**Space:** O(1) - Only a constant amount of extra space is used.
