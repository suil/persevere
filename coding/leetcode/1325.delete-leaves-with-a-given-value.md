### Delete Leaves With a Given Value
[1325. Delete Leaves With a Given Value](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-leaves-with-a-given-value/)

```html
Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.

Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if it's parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you can't).

Example 1:
        1             1          1
      /   \          / \          \
     2     3    =>  2   3    =>    3
    /     / \            \          \
   2     2   4            4          4
Input: root = [1,2,3,2,null,2,4], target = 2
Output: [1,null,3,null,4]
Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed (Picture in left). 
After removing, new nodes become leaf nodes with value (target = 2) (Picture in center).

Example 2:
        1             1
      /   \          /
     3     3   =>   3
    / \              \
   3   2              2
Input: root = [1,3,3,3,2], target = 3
Output: [1,3,null,null,2]

Example 3:
        1          1        1      1
       /          /        /
      2    =>    2   =>   2   =>
     /          /
    2          2
   /
  2
Input: root = [1,2,null,2,null,2], target = 2
Output: [1]
Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed at each step.

Example 4:
Input: root = [1,1,1], target = 1
Output: []

Example 5:
Input: root = [1,2,3], target = 1
Output: [1,2,3]
```

```javascript
var removeLeafNodes = function(root, target) {
    if (root === null) { return null; }
    if (root.left === null && root.right === null && root.val === target) {
        return null;
    }
    root.left = removeLeafNodes(root.left, target);
    root.right = removeLeafNodes(root.right, target);
    return (root.val === target && root.left === null && root.right === null)
        ? null
        : root; 
};
```
