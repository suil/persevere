# Number of Flowers in Full Bloom
[2251. Number of Flowers in Full Bloom](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-flowers-in-full-bloom/)

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array flowers, where flowers[i] = [starti, endi] means the ith flower will be in full bloom from starti to endi (inclusive). You are also given a 0-indexed integer array people of size n, where people[i] is the time that the ith person will arrive to see the flowers.

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} flowers
 * @param {number[]} people
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var fullBloomFlowers = function(flowers, people) {
    const events = [];

    for (const [start, end] of flowers) {
        events.push([start, 1, 'flower']);
        events.push([end + 1, -1]);
    }
    
    for (let i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {
        const time = people[i];
        events.push([time, 0, 'person', i]);
    }

    events.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

    const res = Array(people.length).fill(0);
    let active = 0;
    for (const [time, count, type, personIndex] of events) {
        active += count;
        if (type === 'person') {
            res[personIndex] = active;
        }
    }
    return res;
