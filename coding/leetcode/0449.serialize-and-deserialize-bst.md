# Serialize and Deserialize BST
[449. Serialize and Deserialize BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-bst)

Serialization is converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string, and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

The encoded string should be as compact as possible.

Example 1:
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,1,3]

Example 2:
Input: root = []
Output: []

# Key insights
* Preorder traversal naturally captures BST structure without needing null markers
* BST property enables reconstruction by partitioning values around root during deserialization
* Filter operations split array into left/right subtrees based on BST ordering property
* JSON stringify/parse handles conversion between tree structure and string representation

# Code
```javascript
var serialize = function(root) {
    return JSON.stringify(serializeHelper(root));
};
function serializeHelper(node) {
    if (node === null) {
        return [];
    }
    return [
        node.val,
        ...serializeHelper(node.left),
        ...serializeHelper(node.right)
    ];
}
var deserialize = function(data) {
    return deserializeHelper(JSON.parse(data));
};
function deserializeHelper(array) {
    if (!array || array.length === 0) {
        return null;
    }
    const node = new TreeNode(array[0]);
    node.left = deserializeHelper(array.filter(n => n < array[0]));
    node.right = deserializeHelper(array.filter(n => n > array[0]));
    return node;
}
```

# Complexity
**Serialize:**
**Time:** O(n²) - spread operator creates new arrays at each recursive call, leading to quadratic copying overhead
**Space:** O(n²) - intermediate arrays created during spread operations result in quadratic space usage

**Deserialize:**
**Time:** O(n²) - filter operations at each node create O(n) work, resulting in O(n²) total time for unbalanced trees
**Space:** O(n²) - filter creates new arrays at each recursive call, plus O(n) recursion depth
