# Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero
[1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-to-zero/)

Given an integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero.

# Key insights
- Directly simulates the process: divide by 2 if even, subtract 1 if odd
- Each step reduces the number, and every even step halves it, ensuring fast convergence
- Counts each operation until the number reaches zero

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} num
 * @return {number}
 */
var numberOfSteps = function(num) {
    let steps = 0;
    while (num > 0) {
        if (num % 2 === 0) {
            num /= 2;
        } else {
            num -= 1;
        }
        steps++;
    }
    return steps;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(log n) -- the number is halved frequently, so steps are proportional to the number of bits
**Space:** O(1) -- only a counter and the number variable
