### Delete Node in a BST
[450. Delete Node in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/)

```html
Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

Search for a node to remove.
If the node is found, delete the node.
Follow up: Can you solve it with time complexity O(height of tree)?

Example 1:
        5                       5   
      /   \                   /   \   
     3     6       =>        4     6   
    / \     \               /       \  
   2   4     7             2         7
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.

Example 2:
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.
Example 3:

Input: root = [], key = 0
Output: []
```

```javascript
var deleteNode = function(root, key) {
    if (root === null) { return null; }
    
    if (key < root.val) {
        root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key);
    } else if (key > root.val) {
        root.right = deleteNode(root.right, key);
    } else { // equal
        if (root.left === null || root.right === null) {
            return root.left || root.right;
        }
        // has two children
        let next = root.right;
        while (next.left) {
            next = next.left;
        }
        const node = new TreeNode(next.val);
        node.left = root.left;
        node.right = deleteNode(root.right, next.val);
        return node;
    }
    return root;
};
