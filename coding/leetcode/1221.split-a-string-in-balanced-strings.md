# Split a String in Balanced Strings
[1221. Split a String in Balanced Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-a-string-in-balanced-strings/)

Balanced strings are those that have an equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.

# Key insights
- Greedily counts balanced substrings by tracking the running count of 'L' and 'R' characters
- Whenever the counts of 'L' and 'R' become equal, a balanced substring is found and the counter increments
- Greedy splitting at the earliest balance point maximizes the number of balanced substrings

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var balancedStringSplit = function(s) {
    const map = new Map();
    let count = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        map.set(s[i], (map.get(s[i]) || 0) + 1);
        if (map.get('L') === map.get('R')) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) -- single pass through the string
**Space:** O(1) -- the map has at most 2 keys ('L' and 'R')
