# Student Attendance Record I
[551. Student Attendance Record I](https://leetcode.com/problems/student-attendance-record-i/)

You are given a string s representing an attendance record for a student where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:

# Key insights
- Single pass: count 'A' occurrences and check for 3 consecutive 'L's simultaneously
- Return false immediately if 3 consecutive 'L's are found, or if 'A' count reaches 2
- Early termination with `countA < 2` in the loop condition avoids unnecessary iteration

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var checkRecord = function(s) {
    let countA = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length && countA < 2; i++) {
        if (s[i] == 'A') {
            countA++;
        }
        if (i <= s.length - 3 && s[i] == 'L' && s[i + 1] == 'L' && s[i + 2] == 'L') {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return countA < 2;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) -- single pass through the string
**Space:** O(1)
