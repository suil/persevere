# Sliding Window Maximum
[239. Sliding Window Maximum](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/)

You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return the max sliding window.

# Key insights
* Use a monotonic decreasing deque to maintain candidates for the maximum
* The front of the deque always holds the index of the current window's maximum
* Remove indices from the back when the new element is larger (they can never be the max)
* Remove from the front when the index falls outside the current window

# Code
```javascript
var maxSlidingWindow = function(nums, k) {
    const queue = []; // index
    const res = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (queue.length > 0 && queue[0] <= i - k) { queue.shift(); }

        while (queue.length > 0 && nums[queue.at(-1)] < nums[i]) {
            queue.pop();
        }

        queue.push(i);

        if (i >= k - 1) {
            res.push(nums[queue[0]]);
        }
    }

    return res;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - Each element is pushed and popped from the deque at most once.**Space:** O(k) - The deque holds at most k elements.
