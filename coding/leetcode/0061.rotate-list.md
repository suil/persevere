# Rotate List
[61. Rotate List](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/)

Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.

Example 1:
          1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
rotate 1: 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
rotate 2: 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [4,5,1,2,3]

Example 2:
          0 -> 1 -> 2
rotate 1: 2 -> 0 -> 1
rotate 2: 1 -> 2 -> 0
rotate 3: 0 -> 1 -> 2
rotate 4: 2 -> 0 -> 1

Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
Output: [2,0,1]

# Key insights
* Convert linear list to circular by connecting tail to head
* Use modulo arithmetic to handle k larger than list length
* Find new tail by moving (len - k % len - 1) steps from original head
* Break circular connection at new tail to form rotated list

# Code
```javascript
var rotateRight = function(head, k) {
    if (head === null) { return null; }
    let p = head;
    let len = 1;
    while (p.next) {
        p = p.next;
        len++;
    }
    p.next = head;
    
    let newHead;
    for (let i = 0; i < len - Math.floor(k % len) - 1; i++) {
        head = head.next;
    }
    newHead = head.next;
    head.next = null;
    return newHead;
}
