# Merge Strings Alternately
[1768. Merge Strings Alternately](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/)

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

 
Example 1:


Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r


Example 2:


Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s


Example 3:


Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d


 
Constraints:


	1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
	word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

# Key insights
- Use two pointers, one for each string
- Alternate by checking if result length is even (take from word1) or odd (take from word2)
- After main loop, append remaining characters from whichever string is longer

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} word1
 * @param {string} word2
 * @return {string}
 */
var mergeAlternately = function(word1, word2) {
    let p1 = 0;
    let p2 = 0;

    let res = '';
    while (p1 < word1.length && p2 < word2.length) {
        if (res.length % 2 === 0) {
            res += word1[p1];
            p1++;
        } else {
            res += word2[p2];
            p2++;
        }
    }

    while (p1 < word1.length) {
        res += word1[p1];
        p1++;
    }
    while (p2 < word2.length) {
        res += word2[p2];
        p2++;
    }
    return res;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n + m) - single pass through both strings
**Space:** O(n + m) - for building the result string
