# Course Schedule
[207. Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/description/)

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
Example 2:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

# Key insights
* Convert prerequisites to adjacency list graph representation
* Use DFS with cycle detection to determine if topological ordering exists
* Track visiting nodes separately from visited to detect back edges (cycles)
* Three-color DFS: white (unvisited), gray (visiting), black (visited)

# Code
```javascript
var canFinish = function(numCourses, prerequisites) {
    const graph = [...Array(numCourses)].map(_ => []);
    for (const [course, dependency] of prerequisites) {
        if (!graph[course]) {
            graph[course] = [];
        }
        graph[course].push(dependency);
    }

    const visited = [];
    const visiting = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
        if (hasCircle(graph, i, visited, visiting)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
};

function hasCircle(graph, current, visited, visiting) {
    if (visited[current]) {
        return false;
    }
    
    if (visiting[current]) {
        return true;
    }
    
    visiting[current] = true;
    
    for (const neighbor of graph[current]) {
        if (hasCircle(graph, neighbor, visited, visiting)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    visiting[current] = false;
    visited[current] = true;
    return false;
}
