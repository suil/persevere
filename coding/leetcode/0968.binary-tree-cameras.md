### Binary Tree Cameras
[968. Binary Tree Cameras](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-cameras/)

```html
Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree. 

Each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

Example 1:


Input: [0,0,null,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.
Example 2:


Input: [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.
```

```javascript
// 0: not monitored yet
// 1: put a camera here
// 2: no camera, but can be monitored (a null)
var minCameraCover = function(root) {
    let total = 0;

    function helper(node) {
        if (node == null) { return 2; }
        const left = helper(node.left);
        const right = helper(node.right);

        if (left === 0 || right === 0) {
            total += 1;
            return 1;
        }

        if (left === 2 && right === 2) {
            return 0;
        }
        return 2;
    }
    
    if (helper(root) === 0) {
        total += 1;
    }
    return total;
};
```
