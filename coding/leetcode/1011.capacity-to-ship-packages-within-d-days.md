# Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days
[1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days](https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/)

A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within days days.

The ith package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i]. Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.

Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within days days.

Example 1:

Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], days = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed.
Example 2:

Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], days = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
1st day: 3, 2
2nd day: 2, 4
3rd day: 1, 4
Example 3:

Input: weights = [1,2,3,1,1], days = 4
Output: 3
Explanation:
1st day: 1
2nd day: 2
3rd day: 3
4th day: 1, 1
 
Constraints:

1 <= days <= weights.length <= 5 * 104
1 <= weights[i] <= 500

# Key insights

- **Binary search on the answer**: the capacity is monotonic — if capacity `c` works, any `c' > c` also works, making it suitable for binary search
- Search range: `left = max(weights)` (must fit the heaviest single package), `right = sum(weights)` (ship everything in one day)
- **Greedy feasibility check**: for a given capacity, greedily load packages in order; when adding the next package would exceed capacity, start a new day
- If the greedy check uses `<= days` days, the capacity is feasible — search lower; otherwise search higher
- `invalid, invalid, invalid, valid, valid...`

# Code
```javascript
var shipWithinDays = function(weights, days) {
    function canShip(load) {
        let sum = 0;
        let totalDays = 1;
        for (let i = 0; i < weights.length; i++) {
            if (weights[i] + sum > load) {
                sum = 0;
                totalDays++;
            }
            sum += weights[i];
        }
        return totalDays <= days;
    }

    const total = weights.reduce((sum, w) => sum + w, 0);
    const maxW = Math.max(...weights);

    let left = maxW;
    let right = total;
    let res = total;

    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

        if (canShip(mid)) {
            right = mid - 1;
            res = Math.min(res, mid);
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return res;
};
```

# Complexity
- **Time**: O(n log S) where n = number of packages and S = sum(weights) − max(weights) is the binary search range. Each feasibility check is O(n).
- **Space**: O(1)
