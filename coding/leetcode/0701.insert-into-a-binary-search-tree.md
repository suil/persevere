# Insert into a Binary Search Tree
[701. Insert into a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-into-a-binary-search-tree/)

You are given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value to insert into the tree. Return the root node of the BST after the insertion. It is guaranteed that the new value does not exist in the original BST.

Notice that there may exist multiple valid ways for the insertion, as long as the tree remains a BST after insertion. You can return any of them.

Example 1:

        4                       4
      /   \                   /   \
     2     7    ====>        2     7
    / \                     / \   /
   1   3                   1   3 5

Or:
        5
      /   \
     2     7
    / \
   1   3
        \
         4
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
Output: [4,2,7,1,3,5]
Explanation: Another accepted tree is:

Example 2:

Input: root = [40,20,60,10,30,50,70], val = 25
Output: [40,20,60,10,30,50,70,null,null,25]
Example 3:

Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,null,null,null,null,null,null], val = 5
Output: [4,2,7,1,3,5]

# Key insights
* Leverage BST property: values less than root go left, greater go right
* Use recursion to traverse to the correct insertion position
* Base case: insert new node when reaching null position
* Time O(h) where h is tree height, space O(h) for recursion stack

# Code
```javascript
var insertIntoBST = function(root, val) {
    if (!root) { return new TreeNode(val); }
    if (val > root.val) {
        root.right = insertIntoBST(root.right, val);
    } else {
        root.left = insertIntoBST(root.left, val);
    }
    return root;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(h) - where h is the height of the tree, as we traverse from root to leaf in worst case (O(log n) for balanced BST, O(n) for skewed BST)
**Space:** O(h) - due to recursive call stack depth which equals the height of the tree
