# Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons
[452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/)

There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend] denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

# Key insights
- Sort balloons by start position
- Greedy: track the intersection of overlapping balloons
- When a new balloon doesn't overlap with current intersection, need a new arrow
- Update intersection end to be minimum of current ends (tightest constraint)

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} points
 * @return {number}
 */
var findMinArrowShots = function(points) {
    points.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

    /*
        [1,     6]
           2,       8]
           2, 7
    */
    let count = 1;
    let [, prevEnd] = points[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {
        const [currStart, currEnd] = points[i];
        if (currStart <= prevEnd) { // overlap
            prevEnd = Math.min(prevEnd, currEnd);
        } else { // not overlapped
            prevEnd = currEnd;
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n log n) - dominated by sorting
**Space:** O(1) - only using variables (or O(log n) for sorting)
