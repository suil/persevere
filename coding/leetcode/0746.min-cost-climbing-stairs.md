# Min Cost Climbing Stairs
[746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/)

You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of ith step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

# Key insights
- Bottom-up DP where dp[i] represents the minimum cost to reach step i
- At each step, choose the cheaper option: come from one step back or two steps back (adding the respective cost)
- Base cases dp[0] = dp[1] = 0 since you can start at either step 0 or step 1 for free

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} cost
 * @return {number}
 */
var minCostClimbingStairs = function(cost) {
    const dp = Array(cost.length + 1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 0;
    dp[1] = 0;

    for (let i = 2; i <= cost.length; i++) {
        dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i - 1] + cost[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + cost[i - 2]);
    }

    return dp[cost.length];
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n)
**Space:** O(n) for the dp array
