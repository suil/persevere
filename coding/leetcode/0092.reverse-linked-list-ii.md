# Reverse Linked List II
[92. Reverse Linked List II](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/)

Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the reversed list.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
Example 2:

Input: head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
Output: [5]

# Key insights
- Add a dummy node to avoid special-casing head reversals (left == 1).
Move prev to the node just before position left.
- Use head-insertion: repeatedly take curr.next and insert it after prev to reverse the segment.
Do exactly right - left iterations; each moves one node into the reversed prefix.
- After reversal, prev.next is new sublist head and curr is its tail pointing to the remainder.
- Edge cases: left == right (no-op), single-node lists handled by dummy.

# Code
```javascript
var reverseBetween = function(head, left, right) {
    let dummy = new ListNode(0, head); // FIX: create dummy to simplify head manipulations
    let prev = dummy;
    // move prev to the node just before the `left`-th node
    for (let i = 1; i < left; i++) {
        prev = prev.next;
    }
    // reverse the sublist using head-insertion technique
    let curr = prev.next;
    for (let i = 0; i < right - left; i++) {
        let next = curr.next;
        curr.next = next.next;
        next.next = prev.next;
        prev.next = next;
    }
    return dummy.next;
};
```
