# Binary Tree Upside Down
[156. Binary Tree Upside Down](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-upside-down/)

Given a binary tree where all the right nodes are either leaf nodes with a sibling (a left node that shares the same parent node) or empty, flip it upside down and turn it into a tree where the original right nodes turned into left leaf nodes. Return the new root.

Example:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]

    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5

Output: return the root of the binary tree [4,5,2,#,#,3,1]

   4
  / \
 5   2
    / \
   3   1  

# Key insights
* Recursive post-order traversal to process nodes from bottom-up
* Transform tree by making left child the new parent and reassigning connections
* Base case stops at leftmost node which becomes the new root
* Clean up original node pointers to avoid cycles in transformed tree

# Code
```javascript
var upsideDownBinaryTree = function(root) {
    if (root === null) {
        return null;
    }
    if (!root.left) { return root; }
    var newRoot = upsideDownBinaryTree(root.left);
    root.left.left = root.right;
    root.left.right = root;
    root.left = null;
    root.right = null;
    return newRoot;
};
```
