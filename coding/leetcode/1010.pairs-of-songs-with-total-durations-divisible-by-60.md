# Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60
[1010. Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60](https://leetcode.com/problems/pairs-of-songs-with-total-durations-divisible-by-60/)

You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of time[i] seconds.

# Key insights
- Similar to two-sum but with modular arithmetic: for each song, compute its remainder mod 60 and look for its complement (60 - r) % 60
- Uses a frequency map to count previously seen remainders, so each new song pairs with all prior songs having the matching complement
- The (60 - r) % 60 formula handles the edge case where r = 0 (complement is also 0, not 60)

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} time
 * @return {number}
 */
var numPairsDivisibleBy60 = function(time) {
    const freq = new Map(); // remainder -> count
    let res = 0;

    for (const t of time) {
        const r = t % 60;
        const complement = (60 - r) % 60;

        if (freq.has(complement)) {
            res += freq.get(complement);
        }

        freq.set(r, (freq.get(r) || 0) + 1);
    }

    return res;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) -- single pass through the songs array
**Space:** O(1) -- the map stores at most 60 distinct remainders
