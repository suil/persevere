# Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II
[154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/)

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,4] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,4,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums that may contain duplicates, return the minimum element of this array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,5]

Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0

# Key insights
* Binary search on rotated array by comparing pivot with right boundary
* Handle duplicates by shrinking search space when pivot equals right element
* Avoid infinite loops by decrementing right pointer instead of moving pivot
* Achieves O(log n) average case, O(n) worst case due to duplicate handling

# Code
```javascript
var findMin = function(nums) {
    let lo = 0, hi = nums.length - 1;

    while (lo < hi) {
        const pivot = Math.floor(lo + (hi - lo) / 2);
        if (nums[pivot] < nums[hi]) {
            hi = pivot;
        } else if (nums[pivot] > nums[hi]) {
            lo = pivot + 1;
        } else {
            hi -= 1;
        }
    }
    return nums[lo];
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - In the worst case when all elements are duplicates, we must decrement hi one by one, making it linear time
**Space:** O(1) - Only uses a constant amount of extra space for variables lo, hi, and pivot
