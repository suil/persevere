# Delete Node in a Linked List
[237. Delete Node in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/)

There is a singly-linked list head and we want to delete a node node in it.

# Key insights
- Cannot access the previous node, so traditional deletion is not possible
- Instead, copy the value from the next node into the current node
- Then delete the next node by updating the current node's next pointer

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} node
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify node in-place instead.
 */
var deleteNode = function(node) {
    node.val = node.next.val;
    node.next = node.next.next;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(1) - only modifying two properties
**Space:** O(1) - no extra space used
