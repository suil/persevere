# Add Two Numbers
[2. Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:
2 -> 4 -> 3
5 -> 6 -> 4
-----------
7 -> 0 -> 7
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

Example 2:
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]

Example 3:
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

# Key insights
* Use dummy head node to simplify linked list construction and avoid edge cases
* Simulate elementary school addition with carry propagation digit by digit
* Handle unequal length lists by treating missing nodes as value 0
* Single pass traversal with O(max(m,n)) time and O(max(m,n)) space complexity

# Code
```javascript
var addTwoNumbers = function(l1, l2) {
    let carry = 0;
    let head = new ListNode();
    let p = head;
    
    while (l1 !== null || l2 !== null) {
        const p1Val = l1 ? l1.val : 0;
        const p2Val = l2 ? l2.val : 0;
        const sum = p1Val + p2Val + carry;
        carry = Math.floor(sum / 10);
        p.next = new ListNode(sum % 10);
        p = p.next;
        if (l1 !== null) { l1 = l1.next; }
        if (l2 !== null) { l2 = l2.next; }
    }

    if (carry > 0) {
        p.next = new ListNode(carry);
    }
    return head.next;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(max(m, n)) - The algorithm iterates through both linked lists once, where m and n are the lengths of the input lists.
**Space:** O(max(m, n)) - Creates a new linked list with at most max(m, n) + 1 nodes to store the result.
