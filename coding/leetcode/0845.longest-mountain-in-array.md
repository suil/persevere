# Longest Mountain in Array
[845. Longest Mountain in Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-mountain-in-array/)

You may recall that an array arr is a mountain array if and only if arr.length >= 3 and there exists some index i such that arr[0] < ... < arr[i] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1].

Given an integer array arr, return the length of the longest subarray which is a mountain. Return 0 if there is no mountain subarray.

# Key insights
* For each index, compute how many consecutive increasing elements are to its left and how many consecutive decreasing elements are to its right
* A valid mountain peak at index i requires both left[i] > 0 and right[i] > 0
* The mountain length at peak i is left[i] + right[i] + 1

# Code
```javascript
var longestMountain = function(arr) {
    let maxLen = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
        if (arr[i - 1] < arr[i] && arr[i] > arr[i + 1] ) {
            console.log({i})
            let left = i;
            while (left >= 0 && arr[left] > arr[left - 1]) left--;

            let right = i;
            while (right <= arr.length - 1 && arr[right] > arr[right + 1]) right++;

            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
        }
    }

    return maxLen
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - Three linear passes through the array.

**Space:** O(n) - Two arrays to store the up and down counts.
