# Longest Word in Dictionary
[720. Longest Word in Dictionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-word-in-dictionary/)

Given an array of strings words representing an English Dictionary, return the longest word in words that can be built one character at a time by other words in words.

# Key insights
- Sorting lexicographically ensures shorter prefixes appear before longer words, so buildable words are encountered in order
- A word is buildable if its prefix (word minus last character) is already in the set
- Seed the set with empty string so single-character words are always buildable

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @return {string}
 */
var longestWord = function(words) {
    
    const set = new Set();
    set.add('');

    words.sort();

    let res = '';
    for (const word of words) {
        if (set.has(word.substring(0, word.length - 1))) {
            set.add(word);
            if (word.length > res.length || word.length === res.length && word < res) {
                res = word;
            }
        }
    }
    return res;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n log n + n * L) where n is number of words and L is average word length (sorting + iterating with substring)
**Space:** O(n * L) for the set storing buildable words
