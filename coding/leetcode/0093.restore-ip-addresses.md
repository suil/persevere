# Restore IP Addresses
[93. Restore IP Addresses](https://leetcode.com/problems/restore-ip-addresses/description/)

A valid IP address consists of exactly four integers separated by single dots. Each integer is between 0 and 255 (inclusive) and cannot have leading zeros.

For example, "0.1.2.201" and "192.168.1.1" are valid IP addresses, but "0.011.255.245", "192.168.1.312" and "192.168@1.1" are invalid IP addresses.
Given a string s containing only digits, return all possible valid IP addresses that can be formed by inserting dots into s. You are not allowed to reorder or remove any digits in s. You may return the valid IP addresses in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "25525511135"
Output: ["255.255.11.135","255.255.111.35"]
Example 2:

Input: s = "0000"
Output: ["0.0.0.0"]
Example 3:

Input: s = "101023"
Output: ["1.0.10.23","1.0.102.3","10.1.0.23","10.10.2.3","101.0.2.3"]

# Key insights
* Use backtracking to explore all possible segment combinations recursively
* Validate segments: must be ≤255 and cannot have leading zeros (except '0')
* Prune early when 4 segments reached or string exhausted to avoid invalid paths
* Try 1-3 character segments at each step, breaking on first invalid segment

# Code
```javascript
var restoreIpAddresses = function(s) {
    const output = [];
    restoreIpAddressesHelper(s, [], output);
    return output;
};

function restoreIpAddressesHelper(s, segments, output) {
    if (s.length === 0 || segments.length >= 4) {
        if (s.length === 0 && segments.length === 4) {
            output.push(segments.join('.'));
        }
        return;
    }
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= Math.min(3, s.length); i++) {
        const segment = s.substring(0, i);
        
        if (Number(segment) > 255 || /^0\d/.test(segment)) {
            break;
        }
        
        const nextS = s.substring(i);
        const nextSegments = [...segments, segment];
        restoreIpAddressesHelper(nextS, nextSegments, output);
    }
}
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(3^4) - In the worst case, we try up to 3 choices for each of the 4 IP segments, leading to at most 3^4 = 81 recursive calls.

**Space:** O(4) - The recursion depth is at most 4 (for 4 IP segments), and each recursive call uses constant extra space for local variables.
