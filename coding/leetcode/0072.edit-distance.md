# Key insights
* Dynamic programming with 2D table where dp[i][j] represents min operations to convert word1[0:i] to word2[0:j]
* Three possible operations at each step: insert (dp[i][j-1]+1), delete (dp[i-1][j]+1), replace (dp[i-1][j-1]+cost)
* Characters match when word1[i-1] == word2[j-1], so no additional cost needed
* Bottom-up approach building solution from smaller subproblems with O(m*n) time and space

# Code
```hmtl
Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```
```javascript
function memoize(word1, word2, memo) {
    if (memo.has(word1 + word2)) {
        return memo.get(word1 + word2);
    }

    if (word1.length === 0) {
        return word2.length;
    }
    if (word2.length == 0) {
        return word1.length;
    }

    if (word1[0] == word2[0]) {
        return memoize(word1.substring(1), word2.substring(1), memo);
    }

    const insertOperation = memoize(word1, word2.substring(1), memo);
    const deleteOperation = memoize(word1.substring(1), word2, memo);
    const replaceOperation = memoize(word1.substring(1), word2.substring(1), memo);
    const numOfOperations = Math.min(insertOperation, Math.min(deleteOperation, replaceOperation)) + 1;
    memo.set(word1 + word2, numOfOperations);
    return numOfOperations;
}
```
```javascript
var minDistance = function(word1, word2) {
    if (word1 == null || word2 == null) {
        return 0;
    }

    const len1 = word1.length;
    const len2 = word2.length;
    const dp = [...Array(len1 + 1)].map(_ => [...Array(len2 + 1)]);
    
    for (let i = 0; i <= len1; i++) {
        dp[i][0] = i;
    }

    for (let j = 0; j <= len2; j++) {
        dp[0][j] = j;
    }
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= len1; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= len2; j++) {
            if (word1[i - 1] === word2[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + 1;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[len1][len2];
};
```

# Complexity
**Solution 1:**
**Time:** O(n * m * (n + m)) - explores O(n*m) unique subproblems but string concatenation and substring operations take O(n+m) time each
**Space:** O(n * m * (n + m)) - stores O(n*m) memoized results where each key is a concatenated string of length O(n+m), plus O(n+m) recursion depth

**Solution 2:**
**Time:** O(n * m) - fills a 2D DP table with nested loops iterating through all positions
**Space:** O(n * m) - uses a 2D DP array of size (n+1) x (m+1)
