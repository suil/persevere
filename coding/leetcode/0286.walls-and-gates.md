# Walls and Gates
[286. Walls and Gates](https://leetcode.com/problems/walls-and-gates/)

You are given an m x n grid rooms initialized with these three possible values.

# Key insights
- Multi-source BFS: start from all gates (cells with value 0) simultaneously
- Each BFS level represents distance 1, 2, 3... from the nearest gate
- Only update cells with value INF (2147483647), which are empty rooms
- This ensures each room gets the shortest distance to any gate

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} rooms
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify rooms in-place instead.
 */
var wallsAndGates = function(rooms) {
    let queue = [];
    const directions = [[0, 1], [0, -1], [-1, 0], [1, 0]];
    for (let row = 0; row < rooms.length; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col < rooms[0].length; col++) {
            if (rooms[row][col] === 0) {
                queue.push([row, col]);
            }
        }
    }

    let level = 0;
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const nextQueue = [];
        level++;

        for (const item of queue) {
            const [row, col] = item;
            for (const [deltaRow, deltaCol] of directions) {
                const nextRow = row + deltaRow;
                const nextCol = col + deltaCol;
                if (rooms[nextRow]?.[nextCol] !== undefined && rooms[nextRow][nextCol] === 2147483647) {
                    rooms[nextRow][nextCol] = level;
                    nextQueue.push([nextRow, nextCol]);
                }
            }
        }
        queue = nextQueue;
    }
    return rooms;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(m * n) - each cell is visited at most once
**Space:** O(m * n) - queue can hold all cells in worst case
