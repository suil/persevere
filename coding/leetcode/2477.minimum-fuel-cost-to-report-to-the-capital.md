# Minimum Fuel Cost to Report to the Capital
[2477. Minimum Fuel Cost to Report to the Capital](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-fuel-cost-to-report-to-the-capital/)

There is a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) structure country network consisting of n cities numbered from 0 to n - 1 and exactly n - 1 roads. The capital city is city 0. You are given a 2D integer array roads where roads[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists a bidirectional road connecting cities ai and bi.

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} roads
 * @param {number} seats
 * @return {number}
 */
var minimumFuelCost = function(roads, seats) {
    const graph = new Map();
    for (const [u, v] of roads) {
        if (!graph.has(u)) graph.set(u, []);
        if (!graph.has(v)) graph.set(v, []);
        graph.get(u).push(v);
        graph.get(v).push(u);
    }

    let fuel = 0;
    function dfs(node, parent) {
        let reps = 1;
        for (const nei of (graph.get(node) || [])) {
            if (nei === parent) continue;
            const childReps = dfs(nei, node);

            reps += childReps;
            fuel += Math.ceil(childReps / seats);
        }
        return reps;
    }

    dfs(0, -1);
    return fuel;
};
