# Diameter of Binary Tree
[543. Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

Example 1:
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \
    4   5
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1

# Key insights
* Use DFS to calculate depth while tracking global diameter maximum
* Diameter at each node equals sum of left and right subtree depths
* Single traversal combines depth calculation with diameter tracking
* Return height upward while updating diameter as side effect

# Code
```javascript
var diameterOfBinaryTree = function(root) {
    let diameter = 0;
    
    function depthOfTree(node) {
        if (!node) { return 0; }
        const leftDepth = depthOfTree(node.left);
        const rightDepth = depthOfTree(node.right);
        
        diameter = Math.max(diameter, leftDepth + rightDepth);
        
        return 1 + Math.max(leftDepth, rightDepth);
    }
    
    depthOfTree(root);
    return diameter
};
