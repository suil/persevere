# Design Browser History
[1472. Design Browser History](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-browser-history/)

You have a browser of one tab where you start on the homepage and you can visit another url, get back in the history number of steps or move forward in the history number of steps.

# Key insights
- Use two stacks: 'history' for back navigation, 'future' for forward navigation
- Visit: push current to history, clear future (can't go forward after new visit)
- Back: move current to future, pop from history
- Forward: move current to history, pop from future

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} homepage
 */
var BrowserHistory = function(homepage) {
    this.history = [], this.future = [];
    // 'homepage' is the first visited URL.
    this.current = homepage;
};

BrowserHistory.prototype.visit = function(url) {
    // Push 'current' in 'history' stack and mark 'url' as 'current'.
    this.history.push(this.current);
    this.current = url;
    // We need to delete all entries from 'future' stack.
    this.future = [];
};

BrowserHistory.prototype.back = function(steps) {
    // Pop elements from 'history' stack, and push elements in 'future' stack.
    while(steps > 0 && this.history.length != 0) {
        this.future.push(this.current);
        this.current = this.history.pop();
        steps--;
    }
    return this.current;
};

BrowserHistory.prototype.forward = function(steps) {
    // Pop elements from 'future' stack, and push elements in 'history' stack.
    while(steps > 0 && this.future.length != 0) {
        this.history.push(this.current);
        this.current = this.future.pop();
        steps--;
    }
    return this.current;
};

/** 
 * Your BrowserHistory object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * var obj = new BrowserHistory(homepage)
 * obj.visit(url)
 * var param_2 = obj.back(steps)
 * var param_3 = obj.forward(steps)
 */
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(1) for visit, O(steps) for back/forward
**Space:** O(n) - storing all visited URLs
