# Keys and Rooms
[841. Keys and Rooms](https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms/)

There are N rooms and you start in room 0.  Each room has a distinct number in 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1, and each room may have some keys to access the next room. 

Formally, each room i has a list of keys rooms[i], and each key rooms[i][j] is an integer in [0, 1, ..., N-1] where N = rooms.length.  A key rooms[i][j] = v opens the room with number v.

Initially, all the rooms start locked (except for room 0). 

You can walk back and forth between rooms freely.

Return true if and only if you can enter every room.

Example 1:

Input: [[1],[2],[3],[]]
Output: true
Explanation:  
We start in room 0, and pick up key 1.
We then go to room 1, and pick up key 2.
We then go to room 2, and pick up key 3.
We then go to room 3.  Since we were able to go to every room, we return true.
Example 2:

Input: [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
Output: false
Explanation: We can't enter the room with number 2.

# Key insights
* Use DFS traversal starting from room 0 to explore all reachable rooms
* Track visited rooms with Map to avoid cycles and redundant processing
* Compare total rooms with visited count to determine if all are reachable
* Recursive approach processes each key found in current room as next destination

# Code
```javascript
var canVisitAllRooms = function(rooms) {
    const visited = new Map();
    dfs(rooms, 0, visited);
    return rooms.length === visited.size;
};
function dfs(rooms, currentRoom, visited) {
    if (visited.get(currentRoom)) { return; }
    visited.set(currentRoom, true);
    for (const key of rooms[currentRoom]){
        dfs(rooms, key, visited);
    }
}
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(N + E) - visits each room once and processes each key once, where N is number of rooms and E is total number of keys
**Space:** O(N) - uses a Map to track visited rooms and recursive call stack can go up to N levels deep
