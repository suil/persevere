# Sentence Similarity II
[737. Sentence Similarity II](https://leetcode.com/problems/sentence-similarity-ii/)

We can represent a sentence as an array of words, for example, the sentence "I am happy with leetcode" can be represented as arr = ["I","am",happy","with","leetcode"].

Given two sentences sentence1 and sentence2 each represented as a string array and given an array of string pairs similarPairs where similarPairs[i] = [xi, yi] indicates that the two words xi and yi are similar.

Return true if sentence1 and sentence2 are similar, or false if they are not similar.

Two sentences are similar if:

They have the same length (i.e., the same number of words)
sentence1[i] and sentence2[i] are similar.
Notice that a word is always similar to itself, also notice that the similarity relation is transitive. For example, if the words a and b are similar, and the words b and c are similar, then a and c are similar.

Example 1:

Input: sentence1 = ["great","acting","skills"], sentence2 = ["fine","drama","talent"], similarPairs = [["great","good"],["fine","good"],["drama","acting"],["skills","talent"]]
Output: true
Explanation: The two sentences have the same length and each word i of sentence1 is also similar to the corresponding word in sentence2.

Example 2:

Input: sentence1 = ["I","love","leetcode"], sentence2 = ["I","love","onepiece"], similarPairs = [["manga","onepiece"],["platform","anime"],["leetcode","platform"],["anime","manga"]]
Output: true
Explanation: "leetcode" --> "platform" --> "anime" --> "manga" --> "onepiece".
Since "leetcode is similar to "onepiece" and the first two words are the same, the two sentences are similar.

Example 3:

Input: sentence1 = ["I","love","leetcode"], sentence2 = ["I","love","onepiece"], similarPairs = [["manga","hunterXhunter"],["platform","anime"],["leetcode","platform"],["anime","manga"]]
Output: false
Explanation: "leetcode" is not similar to "onepiece".

# Key insights
* Union-Find data structure groups transitively similar words into connected components
* Path compression in find() optimizes subsequent lookups by flattening tree structure
* Compare root representatives of word pairs to check transitive similarity efficiently
* Early length check avoids unnecessary processing when sentences have different sizes

# Code
```javascript
var areSentencesSimilarTwo = function(sentence1, sentence2, similarPairs) {
    if (sentence1.length !== sentence2.length) { return false; }
    
    const uf = new UnionFind();
    for (const [word1, word2] of similarPairs) {
        uf.union(word1, word2);
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < sentence1.length; i++) {
        if (uf.find(sentence1[i]) !== uf.find(sentence2[i])) { return false; }
    }
    return true;
};
class UnionFind {
    constructor() {
        this.roots = {};
    }
    find(key) {
        if (!this.roots[key]) { this.roots[key] = key; }
        if (this.roots[key] === key) { return key; }
        this.roots[key] = this.find(this.roots[key]);
        return this.roots[key];
    }
    union(x, y) {
        const rootX = this.find(x);
        const rootY = this.find(y);
        if (rootX !== rootY) {
            this.roots[rootY] = rootX;
        }
    }
}
