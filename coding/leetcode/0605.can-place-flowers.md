# Can Place Flowers
[605. Can Place Flowers](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-place-flowers/description/)

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

Example 1:
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false

# Key insights
* Greedy approach: plant flowers immediately when valid spot is found
* Handle edge cases by treating array boundaries as empty (0) plots
* Single pass linear scan with O(1) space complexity
* Modify array in-place to prevent planting in adjacent spots

# Code
```javascript
var canPlaceFlowers = function(flowerbed, n) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < flowerbed.length; i++) {
        if (flowerbed[i] == 1) {
            continue;
        }
        const prev = (i == 0 ? 0 : flowerbed[i - 1]);
        const next = (i == flowerbed.length - 1 ? 0 : flowerbed[i + 1]);
        if (prev === 0 && next === 0) {
            count++;
            flowerbed[i] = 1;
        }
    }
    return count >= n;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - single pass through the flowerbed array of length n
**Space:** O(1) - only uses constant extra variables (count, prev, next) regardless of input size
