# Subtree of Another Tree
[572. Subtree of Another Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree/)

Given the roots of two binary trees root and subRoot, return true if there is a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of subRoot and false otherwise.

A subtree of a binary tree tree is a tree that consists of a node in tree and all of this node's descendants. The tree tree could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

Example 1:
     3        
    / \
   4   5
  / \
 1   2

   4
  / \
 1   2

Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: true

Example 2:

     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \
 1   2
    /
   0

Given tree t:
   4
  / \
 1   2

Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: false

# Key insights
* Recursive tree traversal to check every node as potential subtree root
* Separate helper function to verify structural and value equality between trees
* OR logic combines three cases: exact match at current node or subtree in left/right
* Time complexity O(m*n) where each node comparison takes O(min(m,n)) time

# Code
```javascript
var isSubtree = function(s, t) {
    if (s === null && t === null) {
        return true;
    }
    if (s === null || t === null) {
        return false;
    }

    const isSubtreeOnLeft = isSubtree(s.left, t);
    const isSubtreeOnRight = isSubtree(s.right, t);
    
    return isSame(s, t) || isSubtreeOnLeft || isSubtreeOnRight;
};
function isSame(tree1, tree2) {
    if (!tree1 && !tree2) {
        return true;
    }
    if (tree1 === null || tree2 === null) {
        return false;
    }
    
    return tree1.val === tree2.val
        && isSame(tree1.left, tree2.left)
        && isSame(tree1.right, tree2.right)
}
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(M * N) - For each of the M nodes in tree s, we potentially check if it matches tree t using isSame which takes O(N) time in worst case
**Space:** O(M + N) - Recursion depth can go up to M levels for isSubtree calls plus N levels for isSame calls, where M and N are heights of trees s and t respectively
