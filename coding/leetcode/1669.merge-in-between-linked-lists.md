# Merge In Between Linked Lists
[1669. Merge In Between Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-in-between-linked-lists/)

You are given two linked lists: list1 and list2 of sizes n and m respectively.

Remove list1's nodes from the ath node to the bth node, and put list2 in their place.

Return the head of the modified list1.

# Key insights
* Traverse list1 to find the node just before position a (the "start" node) and the node just after position b (the "end" node)
* Connect the start node's next to the head of list2
* Traverse list2 to its tail and connect its next to the end node
* Single pass through list1 is sufficient since a <= b

# Code
```javascript
var mergeInBetween = function(list1, a, b, list2) {
    let curr = list1;
    for (let i = 0; i < a - 1; i++) {
        curr = curr.next;
    }
    let start = curr;

    for (let i = a - 1; i <= b; i++) {
        curr = curr.next;
    }
    let end = curr;

    start.next = list2;
    while (list2.next) {
        list2 = list2.next;
    }
    list2.next = end;

    return list1;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n + m) - Traverse list1 to find the splice points and list2 to find its tail.

**Space:** O(1) - Only a constant amount of extra space is used for pointers.
