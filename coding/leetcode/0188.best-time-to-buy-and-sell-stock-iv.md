### Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV
[188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv)

```html
You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer k.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most k transactions: i.e. you may buy at most k times and sell at most k times.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:

Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
Example 2:

Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
```

```javascript
var maxProfit = function(kTimes, prices) {
    const len = prices.length;
    const maxProfitAfterBuy = [...Array(kTimes)].map(_ => [...Array(len)]);
    const maxProfitAfterSell = [...Array(kTimes)].map(_ => [...Array(len)]);

    for (let i = 0; i < kTimes; i++) {
        maxProfitAfterBuy[i][0] = -prices[0];
        maxProfitAfterSell[i][0] = 0;
    }

    for (let i = 1; i < len; i++) {
        for (let k = 0; k < kTimes; k++) {
            maxProfitAfterSell[k][i] = Math.max(
                maxProfitAfterSell[k][i - 1], // hold,
                maxProfitAfterBuy[k][i - 1] + prices[i] // sell
            );
            maxProfitAfterBuy[k][i] = Math.max(
                maxProfitAfterBuy[k][i - 1], // hold
                (maxProfitAfterSell[k - 1]?.[i - 1] || 0) - prices[i] // buy
            )
        }
    }

    return maxProfitAfterSell[kTimes - 1][len - 1];
};
