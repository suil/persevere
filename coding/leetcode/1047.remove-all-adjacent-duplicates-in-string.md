# Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String
[1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string/)

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. A duplicate removal consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters and removing them.

# Key insights
- Uses a stack to track characters; when the current character matches the stack top, both are removed (pop)
- This naturally handles cascading removals since previous characters become adjacent after a removal
- The remaining stack contents form the final string

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var removeDuplicates = function(s) {
    const stack = [];

    for (const char of s) {
        if (stack.length > 0 && char === stack.at(-1)) {
            stack.pop();
        } else {
            stack.push(char);
        }
    }

    return stack.join('');
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) -- each character is pushed and popped at most once
**Space:** O(n) -- the stack can hold up to n characters
