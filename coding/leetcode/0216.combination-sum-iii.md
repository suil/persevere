### Combination Sum III
[216. Combination Sum III](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iii/)

```html
Find all valid combinations of k numbers that sum up to n such that the following conditions are true:

Only numbers 1 through 9 are used.
Each number is used at most once.
Return a list of all possible valid combinations. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.

Example 1:
Input: k = 3, n = 7
Output: [[1,2,4]]
Explanation:
1 + 2 + 4 = 7
There are no other valid combinations.

Example 2:
Input: k = 3, n = 9
Output: [[1,2,6],[1,3,5],[2,3,4]]
Explanation:
1 + 2 + 6 = 9
1 + 3 + 5 = 9
2 + 3 + 4 = 9
There are no other valid combinations.

Example 3:
Input: k = 4, n = 1
Output: []
Explanation: There are no valid combinations. [1,2,1] is not valid because 1 is used twice.

Example 4:
Input: k = 3, n = 2
Output: []
Explanation: There are no valid combinations.

Example 5:
Input: k = 9, n = 45
Output: [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]]
Explanation:
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45
​​​​​​​There are no other valid combinations.

```javascript
var combinationSum3 = function(k, n) {
    const output = [];
    combinationSum3Helper(k, n, 1, [], output);
    return output;
};
function combinationSum3Helper(k, target, current, combinations, output) {
    const combSum = combinations.reduce((memo, c) => memo + c, 0);
    if (current > 9 || combSum >= target || combinations.length === k) {
        if (combSum === target && combinations.length === k) {
            output.push([...combinations]);
            return;
        }
    }
    
    for (let i = current; i <= 9; i++) {
        const nextCurrent = i + 1;
        const nextCombinations = [...combinations, i];
        combinationSum3Helper(k, target, nextCurrent, nextCombinations, output);
    }
}
