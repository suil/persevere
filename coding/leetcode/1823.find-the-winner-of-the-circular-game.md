# Find the Winner of the Circular Game
[1823. Find the Winner of the Circular Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-winner-of-the-circular-game/)

There are n friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. More formally, moving clockwise from the ith friend brings you to the (i+1)th friend for 1 <= i < n, and moving clockwise from the nth friend brings you to the 1st friend.

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var findTheWinner = function(n, k) {
    const players = [];
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        players.push(i);
    }

    function solve(currentPlayers, startIndex) {
        if (currentPlayers.length === 1) {
            return currentPlayers[0];
        }

        const removalIndex = (startIndex + k - 1) % currentPlayers.length;

        currentPlayers.splice(removalIndex, 1);
        
        return solve(currentPlayers, removalIndex);
    }

    return solve(players, 0);
};
