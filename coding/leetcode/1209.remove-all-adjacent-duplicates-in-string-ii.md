# Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II
[1209. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string-ii/)

You are given a string s and an integer k. You need to repeatedly remove k adjacent duplicate characters from s until no more such removals can be made. Return the resulting string.

# Key insights
* Use a stack that stores pairs of [character, count]
* When the current character matches the top of the stack, increment the count
* When the count reaches k, pop it off (removal happens)
* Otherwise push a new pair with count 1
* Build the result from the remaining stack entries

# Code
```javascript
var removeDuplicates = function(s, k) {
    let stack = [];

    for (const char of s) {
        if (stack.length > 0 && stack.at(-1).char === char) {
            stack.at(-1).count++;
            if (stack.at(-1).count >= k) {
                stack.pop();
            }
        } else {
            stack.push({ char, count: 1 });
        }
    }

    let res = '';
    for (const { char, count } of stack) {
        res += char.repeat(count);
    }

    return res;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - Single pass through the string, each character is pushed and popped at most once.
**Space:** O(n) - The stack can hold up to n entries in the worst case.
