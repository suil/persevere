# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III
[123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii)

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).


Example 1:

Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
Example 3:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

# Key insights
* Dynamic programming with state tracking for buy/sell transactions
* Four states represent optimal profit after each buy/sell action
* Sequential dependency ensures second transaction uses first transaction's profit
* Bottom-up DP approach processes prices chronologically to build optimal solutions

# Code
```javascript
var maxProfit = function(prices) {
    const len = prices.length;
    const maxProfitAfterBuy1 = Array(len);
    const maxProfitAfterBuy2 = Array(len);
    const maxProfitAfterSell1 = Array(len);
    const maxProfitAfterSell2 = Array(len);

    maxProfitAfterBuy1[0] = -prices[0];
    maxProfitAfterBuy2[0] = -prices[0];
    maxProfitAfterSell1[0] = 0;
    maxProfitAfterSell2[0] = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i < len; i++) {
        maxProfitAfterSell2[i] = Math.max(
            maxProfitAfterSell2[i - 1], // hold
            maxProfitAfterBuy2[i - 1] + prices[i] // 2nd sell 
        );
        maxProfitAfterBuy2[i] = Math.max(
            maxProfitAfterBuy2[i - 1], // hold
            maxProfitAfterSell1[i - 1] - prices[i] // 2nd buy
        );
        maxProfitAfterSell1[i] = Math.max(
            maxProfitAfterSell1[i - 1], // hold
            maxProfitAfterBuy1[i - 1] + prices[i] // 1st sell
        );
        maxProfitAfterBuy1[i] = Math.max(
            maxProfitAfterBuy1[i - 1], // hold
            maxProfitAfterSell1[0] - prices[i] // 1st buy
        );
    }

    return maxProfitAfterSell2[len - 1];
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - Single loop through the prices array with constant time operations at each step
**Space:** O(n) - Four arrays of size n are created to store the dynamic programming states
