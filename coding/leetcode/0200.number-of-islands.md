# Number of Islands
[200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)

Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

Example 1:
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3

# Key insights
* Use DFS to explore all connected land cells from each starting point
* Modify grid in-place by marking visited cells as '0' to avoid revisiting
* Count islands by incrementing counter only when encountering unvisited land
* Recursive flood-fill pattern explores all 4 directions from current cell

# Code
```javascript
var numIslands = function(grid) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let row = 0; row < grid.length; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col < grid[0].length; col++) {
            if (grid[row][col] === '1') {
                count++;
            }
            numIslandsHelper(grid, row, col);
        }
    }
    return count;
};
function numIslandsHelper(grid, startRow, startCol) {
    if (grid[startRow] === undefined
        || grid[startRow][startCol] === undefined
        || grid[startRow][startCol] === '0'
    ) {
        return;
    }
    
    grid[startRow][startCol] = '0';
    
    numIslandsHelper(grid, startRow + 1, startCol);
    numIslandsHelper(grid, startRow - 1, startCol);
    numIslandsHelper(grid, startRow, startCol + 1);
    numIslandsHelper(grid, startRow, startCol - 1);
}
```
