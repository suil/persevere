# Employee Free Time
[759. Employee Free Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-free-time/)

We are given a list schedule of employees, which represents the working time for each employee.

Each employee has a list of non-overlapping Intervals, and these intervals are in sorted order.

Return the list of finite intervals representing common, positive-length free time for all employees, also in sorted order.

(Even though we are representing Intervals in the form [x, y], the objects inside are Intervals, not lists or arrays. For example, schedule[0][0].start = 1, schedule[0][0].end = 2, and schedule[0][0][0] is not defined).  Also, we wouldn't include intervals like [5, 5] in our answer, as they have zero length.

# Key insights
- Flatten all employee schedules into one list, sort by start time, then merge overlapping intervals
- Gaps between consecutive merged intervals are the common free time periods
- No need to track which employee owns which interval; only the overall busy/free timeline matters

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * // Definition for an Interval.
 * function Interval(start, end) {
 *    this.start = start;
 *    this.end = end;
 * };
 */

/**
 * @param {Interval[][]} schedule
 * @return {Interval[]}
 */
var employeeFreeTime = function(schedule) {
    const intervals = schedule.flat();

    intervals.sort((a, b) => a.start - b.start);

    const merged = [intervals[0]];
    for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
        const prev = merged.at(-1);
        const curr = intervals[i];
        if (curr.start <= prev.end) {
            prev.end = Math.max(prev.end, curr.end);
        } else {
            merged.push(curr);
        }
    }

    const free = [];
    for (let i = 1; i < merged.length; i++) {
        if (merged[i - 1].end < merged[i].start) {
            free.push(new Interval(merged[i - 1].end, merged[i].start));
        }
    }
    return free;
};

```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n log n) where n is the total number of intervals across all employees**Space:** O(n) for the flattened and merged interval lists
