# Can I Win
[464. Can I Win](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-i-win/)

In the "100 game" two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from 1 to 10. The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins.
What if we change the game so that players cannot re-use integers?
For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers from 1 to 15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.
Given two integers maxChoosableInteger and desiredTotal, return true if the first player to move can force a win, otherwise, return false. Assume both players play optimally.

Example 1:
Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 11
Output: false
Explanation:
No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.
The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.
If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.
The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.
Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.

Example 2:
Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 0
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 1
Output: true

# Key insights
* Uses minimax game theory with memoization to explore all possible winning strategies
* Memoizes game states using picked array as key to avoid redundant calculations
* Early termination optimizations: immediate win check and impossible total check
* Backtracking to try all valid moves while maintaining game state consistency

# Code
```javascript
var canIWin = function(maxChoosableInteger, desiredTotal) {
    const picked = [...Array(maxChoosableInteger + 1)].fill(false);
    const memo = new Map();
    
    if (desiredTotal <= maxChoosableInteger) { return true; }
    
    if ((1 + maxChoosableInteger) / 2 * maxChoosableInteger < desiredTotal) { return false; }

    return canIWinHelper(maxChoosableInteger, desiredTotal, picked, memo);
};
function canIWinHelper(maxChoosableInteger, desiredTotal, picked, memo) {
    const key = picked.toString();
    if (memo.has(key)) { return memo.get(key); }

    for (let i = 1; i <= maxChoosableInteger; i++) {
        if (picked[i]) { continue; }

        picked[i] = true;
        if (desiredTotal - i <= 0
            || !canIWinHelper(maxChoosableInteger, desiredTotal - i, picked, memo)
        ) {
            picked[i] = false;
            memo.set(key, true);
            return true;
        }
        picked[i] = false;
    }

    memo.set(key, false);
    return false;
}
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(2^n * n^2) - explores all 2^n possible subsets of numbers with memoization, where each recursive call iterates through n numbers and string conversion takes O(n) time
**Space:** O(2^n * n) - stores up to 2^n game states in memo map, each represented as a string of length O(n), plus O(n) recursion stack depth
