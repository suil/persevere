# Height Checker
[1051. Height Checker](https://leetcode.com/problems/height-checker/)

A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.

# Key insights
- Creates a sorted copy of the heights array to represent the expected order
- Counts positions where the original and sorted arrays differ
- Simple comparison approach using filter

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} heights
 * @return {number}
 */
var heightChecker = function(heights) {
    const sorted = [...heights].sort((a,b) => a-b);
    return heights.filter((h,i) => sorted[i] !== h).length;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n log n) -- dominated by the sort
**Space:** O(n) -- for the sorted copy
