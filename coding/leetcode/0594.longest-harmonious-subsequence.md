# Longest Harmonious Subsequence
[594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-harmonious-subsequence/)

We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.

# Key insights
- Build a frequency map of all numbers, then for each number check if (num + 1) exists in the map
- A harmonious subsequence with max-min = 1 consists of exactly two distinct values, so the length is freq(num) + freq(num + 1)
- Only check num + 1 (not num - 1) to avoid counting the same pair twice

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var findLHS = function(nums) {
    const freqMap = new Map();
    for (const num of nums) {
        freqMap.set(num, (freqMap.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    }
    
    let max = 0;
    for (const [num, freq] of freqMap) {
        if (freqMap.has(num + 1)) {
            max = Math.max(max, freq + freqMap.get(num + 1));
        }
    }
    return max;    
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) -- one pass to build the map, one pass to check pairs
**Space:** O(n) -- for the frequency map
