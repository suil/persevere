### Check Completeness of a Binary Tree
[958. Check Completeness of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-completeness-of-a-binary-tree/)
```html
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

In a complete binary tree, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Example 1:
      1___
     /    \
    2      3
   / \    / 
  4   5  6
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: true
Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.
Example 2:
      1__
     /   \
    2     3
   / \     \
  4   5     7
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: false
Explanation: The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.
```

```javascript
var isCompleteTree = function(root) {
    let queue = [root];
    let hasNullNode = false;
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const nextQueue = [];
        for (const node of queue) {
            if (node === null) {
                hasNullNode = true;
            } else {
                if (hasNullNode) { return false; }
                nextQueue.push(node.left);
                nextQueue.push(node.right);
            }
        }
        queue = nextQueue;
    }
    return true;
};
