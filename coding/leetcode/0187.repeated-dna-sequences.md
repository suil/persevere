### Repeated DNA Sequences
[187. Repeated DNA Sequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/)
```html
The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.
When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]
Example 2:

Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]
```

```javascript
var findRepeatedDnaSequences = function(s) {
    const seen = new Set();
    const repeated = new Set();

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length - 9; i++) {
        const seq = s.substr(i, 10);
        if (seen.has(seq)) { repeated.add(seq); }
        seen.add(seq);
    }

    return [...repeated];
};
```
