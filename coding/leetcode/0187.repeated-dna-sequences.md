# Repeated DNA Sequences
[187. Repeated DNA Sequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/)

The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.
When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]
Example 2:

Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]

# Key insights
* Use sliding window technique to extract all 10-character substrings
* Two Sets pattern: track seen sequences and identify duplicates separately
* Set data structure provides O(1) lookup for duplicate detection
* Single pass O(n) time complexity with early duplicate identification

# Code
```javascript
var findRepeatedDnaSequences = function(s) {
    const seen = new Set();
    const repeated = new Set();

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length - 9; i++) {
        const seq = s.substr(i, 10);
        if (seen.has(seq)) { repeated.add(seq); }
        seen.add(seq);
    }

    return [...repeated];
};
