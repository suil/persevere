# Shortest Distance to a Character
[821. Shortest Distance to a Character](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-to-a-character/)

Given a string s and a character c that occurs in s, return an array of integers answer where answer.length == s.length and answer[i] is the distance from index i to the closest occurrence of character c in s.

# Key insights
- Two passes: left-to-right tracking distance from the nearest c on the left, right-to-left tracking distance from the nearest c on the right
- Take the minimum of both passes for each position to get the closest occurrence in either direction
- Initialize prev to -Infinity so positions before the first c get a large distance in the first pass

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {character} c
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var shortestToChar = function(s, c) {
    const res = Array(s.length).fill(0);
    let prev = -Infinity;

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] === c) prev = i;
        res[i] = Math.abs(i - prev);
    }

    for (let i = s.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (s[i] === c) prev = i;
        res[i] = Math.min(res[i], Math.abs(i - prev));
    }
    return res;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n)**Space:** O(n) for the result array
