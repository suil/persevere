# Maximum Product Subarray
[152. Maximum Product Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/)

Given an integer array nums, find a contiguous non-empty subarray within the array that has the largest product, and return the product.

It is guaranteed that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.

# Key insights
* Track both maximum and minimum products due to negative numbers potentially becoming maximum
* Dynamic programming approach maintaining running max/min products at each position
* Single pass O(n) time with O(1) space by updating current max/min simultaneously
* Handle negative numbers by swapping max/min since negatives can flip the optimal choice

# Code
```javascript
var maxProduct = function(nums) {
    let max = -Infinity;
    let currentMax = 1;
    let currentMin = 1;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        const prevMax = currentMax;
        currentMax = Math.max(nums[i], prevMax * nums[i], currentMin * nums[i]);
        currentMin = Math.min(nums[i], prevMax * nums[i], currentMin * nums[i]);
        max = Math.max(currentMax, max);               
    }
    return max;
};
```
