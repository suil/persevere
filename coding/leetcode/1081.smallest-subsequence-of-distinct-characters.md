# Smallest Subsequence of Distinct Characters
[1081. Smallest Subsequence of Distinct Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subsequence-of-distinct-characters/)

Given a string s, return the lexicographically smallest subsequence of s that contains all the distinct characters of s exactly once.

# Key insights
- Monotonic stack approach: maintains a lexicographically smallest stack by popping larger characters that still appear later in the string
- Tracks last occurrence of each character to know if it is safe to pop (will appear again)
- Uses a seen Set to skip characters already in the stack, ensuring each character appears exactly once

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var smallestSubsequence = function(s) {
    let stack = [];
    let seen = new Set();
    let occurrence = {};

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        occurrence[s[i]] = i;
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        let char = s[i];
        if (seen.has(char)) continue;
        while (stack.length > 0 && i < occurrence[stack.at(-1)] && stack.at(-1) > char) {
            seen.delete(stack.pop());
        }
        stack.push(char);
        seen.add(char);
    }
    return stack.join('');
};

```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) -- each character is pushed and popped at most once
**Space:** O(1) -- stack and seen set are bounded by 26 distinct characters
