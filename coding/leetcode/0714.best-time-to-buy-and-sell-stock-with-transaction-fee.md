# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee
[714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee)

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer fee representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:

Input: prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
- Buying at prices[0] = 1
- Selling at prices[3] = 8
- Buying at prices[4] = 4
- Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3
Output: 6

# Key insights
* Dynamic programming with state tracking for buy/sell positions
* Two arrays track maximum profit after buying vs selling at each day
* Transaction fee deducted only when selling to optimize profit calculation
* Bottom-up DP builds solution from previous day's optimal decisions

# Code
```javascript
var maxProfit = function(prices, fee) {
    const len = prices.length;
    const maxProfitAfterBuy = Array(len);
    const maxProfitAfterSell = Array(len);
    maxProfitAfterBuy[0] = -prices[0];
    maxProfitAfterSell[0] = 0;
    
    for (let i = 1; i < len; i++) {
        maxProfitAfterSell[i] = Math.max(
            maxProfitAfterSell[i - 1], // on hold
            maxProfitAfterBuy[i - 1] + prices[i] - fee // sell
        );
        maxProfitAfterBuy[i] = Math.max(
            maxProfitAfterBuy[i - 1], // on hold
            maxProfitAfterSell[i - 1] - prices[i]
        );
    }

    return maxProfitAfterSell[len - 1];
};
