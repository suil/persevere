# Maximum Earnings From Taxi
[2008. Maximum Earnings From Taxi](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-earnings-from-taxi/)

There are n points on a road you are driving your taxi on. The n points on the road are labeled from 1 to n in the direction you are going, and you want to drive from point 1 to point n to make money by picking up passengers. You cannot change the direction of the taxi.

The passengers are represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array rides, where rides[i] = [starti, endi, tipi] denotes the ith passenger requesting a ride from point starti to point endi who is willing to give a tipi dollar tip.

For each passenger i you pick up, you earn endi - starti + tipi dollars. You may only drive at most one passenger at a time.

Given n and rides, return the maximum number of dollars you can earn by picking up the passengers optimally.

Note: You may drop off a passenger and pick up a different passenger at the same point.

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, rides = [[2,5,4],[1,5,1]]
Output: 7
Explanation: We can pick up passenger 0 to earn 5 - 2 + 4 = 7 dollars.
Example 2:

Input: n = 20, rides = [[1,6,1],[3,10,2],[10,12,3],[11,12,2],[12,15,2],[13,18,1]]
Output: 20
Explanation: We will pick up the following passengers:
- Drive passenger 1 from point 3 to point 10 for a profit of 10 - 3 + 2 = 9 dollars.
- Drive passenger 2 from point 10 to point 12 for a profit of 12 - 10 + 3 = 5 dollars.
- Drive passenger 5 from point 13 to point 18 for a profit of 18 - 13 + 1 = 6 dollars.
We earn 9 + 5 + 6 = 20 dollars in total.

# Key insights

- This is a dynamic programming problem similar to the weighted job scheduling problem
- Rides need to be sorted by their end points to process them in order
- For each ride, we have two choices: take it or skip it
- If we take a ride, we need to find the maximum earnings from all rides that end before this ride starts
- Binary search can optimize finding the last compatible ride that doesn't overlap
- DP state: `dp[i]` = maximum earnings considering rides up to index `i`
- The earning for a ride is `end - start + tip`

# Code
```javascript
var maxTaxiEarnings = function(n, rides) {
    const ridesByStart = new Map();
    for (const [s, e, tip] of rides) {
        if (!ridesByStart.has(s)) ridesByStart.set(s, []);
        ridesByStart.get(s).push([e, tip]);
    }

    const memo = new Map();

    function dfs(pos) {
        if (pos > n) return 0;
        if (memo.has(pos)) return memo.get(pos);

        let best = dfs(pos + 1);

        if (ridesByStart.has(pos)) {
            for (const [end, tip] of ridesByStart.get(pos)) {
                best = Math.max(
                    best,
                    end - pos + tip + dfs(end)
                );
            }
        }

        memo.set(pos, best);
        return best;
    }

    return dfs(1);
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n + m) where n is the number of points and m is the number of rides. We potentially visit each position from 1 to n once due to memoization, and process each ride once when encountered at its starting position.
**Space:** O(n + m) where n is for the memoization map (storing results for up to n positions) and m is for storing the rides in the ridesByStart map.
