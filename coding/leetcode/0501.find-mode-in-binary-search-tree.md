# Find Mode in Binary Search Tree
[501. Find Mode in Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-mode-in-binary-search-tree/)

Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, return all the mode(s) (i.e., the most frequently occurred element) in it.

If the tree has more than one mode, return them in any order.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 
Example 1:

Input: root = [1,null,2,2]
Output: [2]

Example 2:

Input: root = [0]
Output: [0]

# Key insights
* In-order traversal visits BST nodes in sorted order for systematic processing
* HashMap tracks frequency of each value with O(1) insert and lookup operations
* Two-pass approach: first pass builds frequency map, second pass filters maximum frequencies
* Space complexity O(n) for storing all node frequencies in the hash map

# Code
```javascript
var findMode = function(root) {
    let freqMap = new Map();
    let maxFreq = -Infinity;
    
    function inOrderTraverse(node) {
        if (!node) { return; }
        
        inOrderTraverse(node.left);
        freqMap.set(node.val, (freqMap.get(node.val) || 0) + 1);
        if (freqMap.get(node.val) > maxFreq) {
            maxFreq = freqMap.get(node.val);
        }
        inOrderTraverse(node.right);
    }

    inOrderTraverse(root);

    const res = [];
    for (const [val, freq] of freqMap) {
        if (freq === maxFreq) {
            res.push(val);
        }
    }
    return res;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - visits each node once during in-order traversal, then iterates through the frequency map once
**Space:** O(n) - stores frequency map with up to n entries, plus O(h) recursion stack depth and O(k) result array where k is number of modes
