# Koko Eating Bananas
[875. Koko Eating Bananas](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/)

Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.

Example 1:

Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
Output: 30
Example 3:

Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
Output: 23
 

Constraints:

1 <= piles.length <= 104
piles.length <= h <= 109
1 <= piles[i] <= 109

# Key insights
- Binary search on the answer space - search for minimum eating speed k
- Monotonicity property - if speed k works, all speeds > k also work
- Search bounds - minimum: 1 banana/hour, maximum: max(piles) bananas/hour
- Validation - for speed k, calculate total hours = sum(ceil(pile / k)) for all piles
- Goal - find minimum k where total hours ≤ h
- `invalid, invalid, invalid, valid, valid...`

# Code
```javascript
var minEatingSpeed = function(piles, h) {

    function canEat(k) {
        let hours = 0;
        for (const pile of piles) {
            hours += Math.ceil(pile / k);
        }
        return hours <= h;
    }

    const max = Math.max(...piles);

    let left = 1;
    let right = max;
    let k = max;

    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

        if (canEat(mid)) {
            right = mid - 1;
            k = Math.min(k, mid);
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return k;
};

```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n log m) where: n = number of piles m = max(piles)
**Space:** O(1) - only using constant extra space for pointers and variables
