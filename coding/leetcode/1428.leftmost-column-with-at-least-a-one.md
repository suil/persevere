# Leftmost Column with at Least a One
[1428. Leftmost Column with at Least a One](https://leetcode.com/problems/leftmost-column-with-at-least-a-one/)

A row-sorted binary matrix means that all elements are 0 or 1 and each row of the matrix is sorted in non-decreasing order.

# Key insights
- Start from the top-right corner and use the sorted-row property: move left on finding a 1, move down on finding a 0
- This staircase traversal eliminates entire rows/columns at each step, finding the leftmost 1 efficiently
- Track the last column where a 1 was found; if never moved left, return -1

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * // This is the BinaryMatrix's API interface.
 * // You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation
 * function BinaryMatrix() {
 *     @param {integer} row, col
 *     @return {integer}
 *     this.get = function(row, col) {
 *         ...
 *     };
 *
 *     @return {[integer, integer]}
 *     this.dimensions = function() {
 *         ...
 *     };
 * };
 */

/**
 * @param {BinaryMatrix} binaryMatrix
 * @return {number}
 */
var leftMostColumnWithOne = function(binaryMatrix) {
    let [rows, cols] = binaryMatrix.dimensions()
    let currentRow = 0;
    let currentCol = cols - 1;
    while (currentRow < rows && currentCol >= 0) {
        let val = binaryMatrix.get(currentRow, currentCol)
        if (val === 1) {
            currentCol--
        } else {
            currentRow++
        }
    }
    return (currentCol == cols - 1) ? -1 : currentCol + 1;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(m + n) where m is rows and n is columns, since each step moves either down or left
**Space:** O(1)
