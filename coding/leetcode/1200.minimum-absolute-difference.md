# Minimum Absolute Difference
[1200. Minimum Absolute Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference/)

Given an array of distinct integers arr, find all pairs of elements with the minimum absolute difference of any two elements.

Return a list of pairs in ascending order (with respect to pairs), each pair [a, b] follows:
- a, b are from arr
- a < b
- b - a equals the minimum absolute difference of any two elements in arr

Example 1:

Input: arr = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Explanation: The minimum absolute difference is 1. List all pairs with difference equal to 1 in ascending order.

Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,3,6,10,15]
Output: [[1,3],[3,6],[6,10],[10,15]]

Example 3:

Input: arr = [3,8,-10,23,19,-4,-14,27]
Output: [[-14,-10],[-10,3],[3,8],[19,23],[23,27]]

Constraints:
2 <= arr.length <= 105
-106 <= arr[i] <= 106
All integers in arr are distinct.

# Key insights
- After sorting, the minimum absolute difference can only occur between adjacent elements
- Two passes: first find the minimum difference, then collect all pairs matching it

# Code
```javascript
var minimumAbsDifference = function(arr) {
    arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let minDiff = Infinity;
    let res = [];
    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        const diff = Math.abs(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]);
        if (diff < minDiff) {
            res = [[arr[i - 1], arr[i]]];
            minDiff = diff;
        } else if (diff === minDiff) {
            res.push([arr[i - 1], arr[i]]);
        }
    }
    return res;
};
```

# Complexity
- Time: O(n log n) - dominated by sorting
- Space: O(n) - for the output array
