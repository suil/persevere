# License Key Formatting
[482. License Key Formatting](https://leetcode.com/problems/license-key-formatting/)

You are given a license key represented as a string s that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into n + 1 groups by n dashes. You are also given an integer k.

# Key insights
- Traverse the string from right to left, building groups of size k while skipping dashes
- Convert each character to uppercase as it is added to the current group
- The first group (leftmost) may have fewer than k characters

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {string}
 */
var licenseKeyFormatting = function(s, k) {
    let group = '';
    const res = [];
    for (let i = s.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (s[i] === '-') continue;
        group = s[i].toUpperCase() + group;
        if (group.length === k) {
            res.unshift(group);
            group = '';
        }
    }
    if (group.length !== 0) res.unshift(group)
    return res.join('-');
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) -- single pass through the string
**Space:** O(n) -- for storing the result groups
