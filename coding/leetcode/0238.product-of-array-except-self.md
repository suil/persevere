# Product of Array Except Self
[238. Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

# Key insights
* Two-pass approach: left-to-right for prefix products, right-to-left for suffix products
* Store prefix products in output array, then multiply with suffix products in-place
* Avoids division and handles zeros naturally through multiplication-based approach
* Achieves O(1) extra space by reusing output array for intermediate calculations

# Code
```javascript
var productExceptSelf = function(nums) {
    let product = 1;
    let output = [1];
    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        product *= nums[i - 1];
        output[i] = product;
    }

    product = 1;
    for (let i = nums.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        product *= nums[i + 1];
        output[i] = product * output[i];
    }
    return output;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - Two separate linear passes through the array of length n
**Space:** O(1) - Only uses constant extra space beyond the required output array
