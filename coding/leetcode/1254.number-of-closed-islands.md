# Number of Closed Islands
[1254. Number of Closed Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-closed-islands/)

Given a 2D grid consisting of 0s (land) and 1s (water), return the number of closed islands.

A closed island is an island totally (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by 1s. An island is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of 0s.

# Key insights
* A closed island is a group of land cells (0s) that does not touch any border of the grid
* First, flood-fill (sink) all land connected to the border — these cannot be closed islands
* Then, count remaining land groups with DFS/BFS — each one is a closed island

# Code
```javascript
var closedIsland = function(grid) {
    const rowLen = grid.length;
    const colLen = grid[0].length;

    function dfs(row, col, marker) {
        if (grid[row]?.[col] === undefined || grid[row][col] !== 0) {
            return;
        }

        grid[row][col] = marker;
        
        dfs(row + 1, col);
        dfs(row - 1, col);
        dfs(row, col + 1);
        dfs(row, col - 1);
    }

    for (let row = 0; row < rowLen; row++) {
        dfs(row, 0, 2);
        dfs(row, colLen - 1, 2);
    }

    for (let col = 0; col < colLen; col++) {
        dfs(0, col, 2);
        dfs(rowLen - 1, col, 2);
    }

    let count = 0;
    for (let row = 0; row < rowLen; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col < colLen; col++) {
            if (grid[row][col] == 0) {
                dfs(row, col, 1);
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(m * n) - Each cell is visited at most once during the border flood-fill and the island counting pass.

**Space:** O(m * n) - In the worst case, the DFS recursion stack can grow to the size of the entire grid.
