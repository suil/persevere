# Reconstruct Itinerary
[332. Reconstruct Itinerary](https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/)

You are given a list of airline tickets where tickets[i] = [fromi, toi] represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it.

# Key insights
- Hierholzer's algorithm for finding Eulerian path
- Build adjacency list and sort neighbors lexicographically for smallest result
- DFS always taking the smallest available neighbor first
- Add airports to result when backtracking (unshift to front)

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[][]} tickets
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var findItinerary = function(tickets) {
    const graph = new Map();
    for (const [from, to] of tickets) {
        if (!graph.has(from)) graph.set(from, []);
        graph.get(from).push(to);
    }

    for (const [node, neighbors] of graph) {
        neighbors.sort();
    }
    
    console.log(graph)

    const res = [];
    function dfs(airport) {
        while (graph.get(airport)?.length > 0) {
            dfs(graph.get(airport).shift());
        }
        res.unshift(airport);
    }

    dfs("JFK");
    return res;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(E log E) - where E is number of tickets, dominated by sorting neighbors
**Space:** O(E) - for the graph and recursion stack
