### Unique Paths
[62. Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)

```html
There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). 
The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.
```
 
```javascript
var uniquePaths = function(m, n) {
    const dp = [...Array(m)].map(_ => [...Array(n)].fill(1));
    
    for (let row = 1; row < m; row++) {
        for (let col = 1; col < n; col++) {
            dp[row][col] = dp[row - 1][col] + dp[row][col - 1];
        }
    }
    
    return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
};
```

could use formula to solve this. This is a combination problem.
the total movments is S = m + n - 2. downward movment is D = m - 1.
So the problem is C(S, D).

```java
public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
    int S = m + n - 2;  // total movments
    int D = m - 1;      // downward movments
    long ret = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= D; i++) {
        ret = ret * (S - D + i) / i;
    }
    return (int) ret;
}
```
