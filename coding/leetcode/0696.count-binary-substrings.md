# Count Binary Substrings
[696. Count Binary Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-binary-substrings/)

Given a binary string s, return the number of non-empty substrings that have the same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings are grouped consecutively.

Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.

Example 1:

Input: s = "00110011"
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 0's and 1's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", "01".

Example 2:

Input: s = "10101"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 0's and 1's: "10", "01", "10", "01".

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is either '0' or '1'.

# Key insights
- Group the string into runs of consecutive identical characters (e.g. "00110011" → [2,2,2,2])
- Between any two adjacent groups, the number of valid substrings is min(prevCount, curCount)
- Only need to track the previous and current group sizes — no need to store all groups

# Code
```javascript
var countBinarySubstrings = function(s) {
    let prev = 0, cur = 1, count = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] === s[i - 1]) {
            cur++;
        } else {
            count += Math.min(prev, cur);
            prev = cur;
            cur = 1;
        }
    }
    count += Math.min(prev, cur);
    return count;
};
```

# Complexity
- Time: O(n) - single pass through the string
- Space: O(1)
