# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
[121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Example 2:
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

# Key insights
* Track minimum price seen so far while iterating through array
* Calculate profit at each step using current price minus minimum price
* Single pass O(n) solution with O(1) space using greedy approach
* Update maximum profit incrementally without storing all possible profits

# Code
```javascript
var maxProfit = function(prices) {
    let minPrice = Infinity;
    let maxprofit = -Infinity;
    
    for (const price of prices) {
        minPrice = Math.min(minPrice, price);
        maxprofit = Math.max(maxprofit, price - minPrice);
    }
    return maxprofit;
};
```
