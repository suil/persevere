# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
[121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Example 2:
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

# Key insights
* Track minimum price seen so far while iterating through array
* Calculate profit at each step using current price minus minimum price
* Single pass O(n) solution with O(1) space using greedy approach
* Update maximum profit incrementally without storing all possible profits

# Code
```javascript
var maxProfit = function(prices) {
    const len = prices.length;
    const maxProfitAfterBuy = Array(len).fill(0);
    const maxProfitAfterSell = Array(len).fill(0);

    maxProfitAfterBuy[0] = -prices[0];
    maxProfitAfterSell[0] = 0;

    // sell has to happen after buy
    // buy could happen after sell or buy. but sell could give you a low amount. so only look at last buy

    for (let i = 1; i < len; i++) {
        maxProfitAfterBuy[i] = Math.max(maxProfitAfterBuy[i - 1], -prices[i]);
        maxProfitAfterSell[i] = Math.max(maxProfitAfterSell[i - 1], maxProfitAfterBuy[i - 1] + prices[i]);
    }

    return maxProfitAfterSell[len - 1];
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - single pass through the prices array where n is the number of elements
**Space:** O(1) - only uses a constant amount of extra variables regardless of input size
