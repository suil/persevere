# Merge Intervals
[56. Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

# Key insights
* Sort intervals by start time to process overlaps sequentially
* Use greedy approach - merge current interval with previous if they overlap
* Track previous interval to avoid nested loops and enable single pass
* Extend interval end using Math.max() when overlap is detected

# Code
```javascript
var merge = function(intervals) {
  // edge case
  if (intervals.length === 0) {
    return [];
  }

  // intial state
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

  const output = [intervals[0]];
  let previous = intervals[0];

  for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
    const current = intervals[i];
    const [currentStart, currentEnd] = current;

    if (currentStart > previous[1]) { // no overlapping
      previous = current;
      output.push(current);
    } else { // overlapping
      const extendedEnd = Math.max(previous[1], currentEnd);
      previous[1] = extendedEnd;
      output[output.length - 1][1] = extendedEnd;
    }
  }
  
  return output;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n log n) - dominated by sorting the intervals by start time, followed by a linear pass through the sorted array
**Space:** O(n) - output array stores up to n intervals in worst case when no merging occurs
