# Climbing Stairs
[70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/0070.climbing-stairs/)

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

Example 2:
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

# Key insights
* Dynamic programming approach building solution bottom-up from base cases
* Fibonacci-like recurrence: ways to reach step n = ways to reach (n-1) + (n-2)
* Space-optimized DP using array to store previously computed subproblems
* Linear time O(n) solution avoiding exponential recursion overhead

# Code
```javascript
var climbStairs = function(n) {
    const dp = [1, 2];
    for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n - 1];
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - Single loop iterates from 2 to n-1, performing constant time operations in each iteration.
**Space:** O(n) - Dynamic programming array stores up to n elements to compute the result.
