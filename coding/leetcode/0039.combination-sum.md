# Combination Sum
[39. Combination Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/)

Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.

The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

It is guaranteed that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.

Example 1:
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
Explanation:
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.

Example 2:
Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]

Example 3:
Input: candidates = [2], target = 1
Output: []

Example 4:
Input: candidates = [1], target = 1
Output: [[1]]

Example 5:
Input: candidates = [1], target = 2
Output: [[1,1]]

# Key insights
* Uses backtracking with recursion to explore all possible combinations
* Allows reusing same element by not incrementing index when recursing
* Prunes search space early when current sum equals or exceeds target
* Deep copies combinations array to avoid reference issues in result

# Code
```javascript
var combinationSum = function(candidates, target) {
    const output = [];
    combinationSumHelper(candidates, target, 0, [], output);
    return output;
};

function combinationSumHelper(candidates, target, current, combinations, output) {
    const combSum = combinations.reduce((memo, c) => memo + c, 0);
    if (current >= candidates.length || combSum >= target) {
        if (combSum === target) {
            output.push([...combinations]);
        }
        return;
    }
    
    for (let i = current; i < candidates.length; i++) {
        const nextCurrent = i;
        const nextCombinations = [...combinations, candidates[i]];
        combinationSumHelper(candidates, target, nextCurrent, nextCombinations, output);
    }
}
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(N^(T/M)) - where N is the number of candidates, T is the target value, and M is the minimal value among candidates, representing the worst-case exponential branching where each recursive call explores all remaining candidates up to T/M depth.

**Space:** O(T/M) - the maximum recursion depth is T/M (when using the smallest candidate repeatedly), and each recursive call stores a copy of the current combination array.
