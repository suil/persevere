# Search a 2D Matrix II
[240. Search a 2D Matrix II](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix-ii/description/)

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a target value in an m x n integer matrix. The matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

Example 1:
[ 1, 4, 7,11,15]
[ 2, 5, 8,12,19]
[ 3, 6, 9,16,22]
[10,13,14,17,24]
[18,21,23,26,30]
Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 5
Output: true

Example 2:
[ 1, 4, 7,11,15]
[ 2, 5, 8,12,19]
[ 3, 6, 9,16,22]
[10,13,14,17,24]
[18,21,23,26,30]
Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 20
Output: false

# Key insights
* Binary search on first row to find rightmost column where target could exist
* Algorithm appears incomplete - missing the vertical search component
* Uses modified binary search that returns insertion point when target not found
* Approach attempts to reduce search space by eliminating columns first

# Code
```javascript
var searchMatrix = function(matrix, target) {
    const firstRow = matrix[0];
    const targetColIdex = binarySearch(firstRow, target);
    
    const searchColArray = 
    console.log(targetColIdex)
};
function binarySearch(array, target) {
    let low = 0, high = array.length - 1;
    while (low <= high) {
        const mid = Math.floor(low + (high - low) / 2);
        if (array[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        }
        if (array[mid] > target) {
            high = mid - 1;
        } else {
            low = mid + 1
        }
    }
    return low - 1;
}
