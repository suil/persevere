# Reshape the Matrix
[566. Reshape the Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/reshape-the-matrix/description/)

In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can reshape a matrix into a new one with different size but keep its original data.

You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two positive integers r and c representing the row number and column number of the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively.

The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.

If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

Example 1:
Input: 
nums = 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 1, c = 4
Output: 
[[1,2,3,4]]
Explanation:
The row-traversing of nums is [1,2,3,4]. The new reshaped matrix is a 1 * 4 matrix, fill it row by row by using the previous list.
Example 2:
Input: 
nums = 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 2, c = 4
Output: 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
Explanation:
There is no way to reshape a 2 * 2 matrix to a 2 * 4 matrix. So output the original matrix.

# Key insights
* Validate total elements match before reshaping to avoid invalid operations
* Use single index counter with math operations to map between 1D and 2D coordinates
* Convert 1D index to 2D using division and modulo: row=index/cols, col=index%cols
* Nested loops iterate through target dimensions while sequential indexing preserves order

# Code
```javascript
var matrixReshape = function(nums, r, c) {
    let m = nums.length, n = nums[0].length;
    
    if (m * n != r * c) {
        return nums;
    }
    
    const reshapedNums = [...Array(r)].map(a => [...Array(c)]);

    let index = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < r; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < c; j++) {
            reshapedNums[i][j] = nums[Math.floor(index / n)][index % n];
            index++;
        }
    }
    return reshapedNums;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(r × c) - We iterate through each position in the reshaped matrix once, and each element access/assignment is O(1).
**Space:** O(r × c) - We create a new 2D array with r rows and c columns to store the reshaped matrix.
