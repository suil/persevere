# Find Words That Can Be Formed by Characters
[1160. Find Words That Can Be Formed by Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-words-that-can-be-formed-by-characters/)

You are given an array of strings words and a string chars.

# Key insights
- Builds a frequency map of available characters from chars
- For each word, copies the frequency map and decrements counts as characters are used; if any character is missing or exhausted, the word cannot be formed
- Sums the lengths of all words that can be fully formed

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @param {string} chars
 * @return {number}
 */
var countCharacters = function(words, chars) {
    function canForm(word, map) {
        const freqMap = new Map(map);
        for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
            if (!freqMap.has(word[i]) || freqMap.get(word[i]) === 0) {
                return false;
            }
            freqMap.set(word[i], freqMap.get(word[i]) - 1);
        }
        return true;
    }

    const map = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
        map.set(chars[i], (map.get(chars[i]) || 0) + 1);
    }

    let res = 0;
    for (const word of words) {
        if (canForm(word, map)) {
            res += word.length;
        }
    }
    return res;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n * L + C) -- where n is the number of words, L is max word length, and C is length of chars
**Space:** O(1) -- frequency maps are bounded by 26 lowercase letters
