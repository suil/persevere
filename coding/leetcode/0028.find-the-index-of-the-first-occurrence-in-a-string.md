# Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String
[28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string)

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.

# Key insights
* Use brute force pattern matching with nested loops
* Sliding window approach - check each possible starting position
* Early termination when characters don't match to avoid unnecessary comparisons
* Optimize outer loop bound to haystackLen - needleLen to prevent out-of-bounds

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) {
        int haystackLen = haystack.length();
        int needleLen = needle.length();

        if (needleLen == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        if (haystackLen < needleLen) {
            return -1;
        }

        for (int windowStart = 0; windowStart <= haystackLen - needleLen; windowStart++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < needleLen; j++) {
                if (haystack.charAt(windowStart + j) != needle.charAt(j)) {
                    break;
                }
                if (j == needleLen - 1) {
                    return windowStart;
                }
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }
}
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n * m) - In worst case, we check each position in haystack (n-m+1 positions) and for each position we may compare up to m characters, where n is haystack length and m is needle length.

**Space:** O(1) - Only uses a constant amount of extra variables regardless of input size.
