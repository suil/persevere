# House Robber
[198. House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/)

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

# Key insights
* Dynamic programming with O(1) space optimization using two variables
* Track maximum money robbed with and without robbing current house
* Bottom-up approach building optimal solution from previous decisions
* Single pass through array with constant space instead of DP table

# Code
```java
public int rob(int[] nums) {
    int pre2 = 0, pre1 = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int cur = Math.max(pre2 + nums[i], pre1);
        pre2 = pre1;
        pre1 = cur;
    }
    return pre1;
}
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - Single pass through the array to compute maximum robbery amount at each house
**Space:** O(1) - Only uses constant extra space with three variables (pre2, pre1, cur)
