# Count of Smaller Numbers After Self
[315. Count of Smaller Numbers After Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-smaller-numbers-after-self/)

You are given an integer array nums and you have to return a new counts array. The counts array has the property where counts[i] is the number of smaller elements to the right of nums[i].

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,2,6,1]
Output: [2,1,1,0]
Explanation:
To the right of 5 there are 2 smaller elements (2 and 1).
To the right of 2 there is only 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 6 there is 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 1 there is 0 smaller element.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1]
Output: [0]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [-1,-1]
Output: [0,0]

# Key insights
* Uses merge sort with modified merge step to count inversions while sorting
* Maps values to original indices to track inversion counts during array rearrangement
* Accumulates inversion count during merge - elements from right that were smaller
* Divide and conquer approach achieves O(n log n) time vs naive O(n²) solution

# Code
```javascript
var countSmaller = function(nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0 || !nums) return nums;

    let inversion = Array(nums.length).fill(0);
    let map = nums.map((val, index) => ({ val, index}));

    var merge = function(arr) {
        if (arr.length == 1) { return arr; }
        let mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2)
        let left = merge(arr.slice(0, mid));
        let right = merge(arr.slice(mid));
        
        let leftIndex = 0, rightIndex = 0, inversionCount = 0, sorted = [];
        // compare numbers from left part to right part
        while (leftIndex < left.length) {
            if (right[rightIndex] && left[leftIndex].val > right[rightIndex].val) {
                // inversion found
                inversionCount++;
                sorted.push(right[rightIndex++]);
            } else {
                // no inversions for this number (or right is exhausted)
                // update its inversion count up to the current stack
                inversion[left[leftIndex].index] += inversionCount;
                sorted.push(left[leftIndex++]);
            }
        }

        // deal with left over right values and return
        return [...sorted, ...right.slice(rightIndex)];        
    }

    merge(map);
    return inversion;
};
