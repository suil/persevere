# Implement Queue using Stacks
[232. Implement Queue using Stacks](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/)

Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).

# Key insights
- Use two stacks: `inStack` for push operations, `outStack` for pop/peek operations
- When popping or peeking, if `outStack` is empty, transfer all elements from `inStack` to `outStack` (this reverses the order, giving FIFO behavior)
- Each element is moved at most twice (once to inStack, once to outStack), giving amortized O(1) per operation

# Code
```javascript

var MyQueue = function() {
    this.inStack = [];
    this.outStack = []; // use to reverse the order
};

/** 
 * @param {number} x
 * @return {void}
 */
MyQueue.prototype.push = function(x) {
    this.inStack.push(x);
};

/**
 * @return {number}
 */
MyQueue.prototype.pop = function() {
    if (this.outStack.length === 0) {
        while (this.inStack.length > 0) this.outStack.push(this.inStack.pop());
    }
    return this.outStack.pop();
};

/**
 * @return {number}
 */
MyQueue.prototype.peek = function() {
    if (this.outStack.length === 0) {
        while (this.inStack.length > 0) this.outStack.push(this.inStack.pop());
    }
    return this.outStack.at(-1)
};

/**
 * @return {boolean}
 */
MyQueue.prototype.empty = function() {
    return this.inStack.length === 0 && this.outStack.length === 0
};

/** 
 * Your MyQueue object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * var obj = new MyQueue()
 * obj.push(x)
 * var param_2 = obj.pop()
 * var param_3 = obj.peek()
 * var param_4 = obj.empty()
 */
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(1) amortized for all operations (each element is pushed and popped at most twice)
**Space:** O(n) - where n is the number of elements in the queue
