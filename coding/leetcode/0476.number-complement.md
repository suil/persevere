# Number Complement
[476. Number Complement](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/)

The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.

# Key insights
- Process each bit from LSB to MSB; if a bit is 0, set the corresponding bit in the result using `1 << i`
- Right-shift the number each iteration to examine the next bit, stopping when the number becomes 0
- This avoids flipping leading zeros beyond the most significant bit

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} num
 * @return {number}
 */
var findComplement = function(num) {
    
    let result = 0;
    let i = 0;

    while (num > 0) {
        if ((num & 1) === 0) {
            result += (1 << i);
        }
        i++;
        num >>= 1;
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(log n) -- iterates through each bit of the number
**Space:** O(1)
