# Guess Number Higher or Lower
[374. Guess Number Higher or Lower](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/)

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

# Key insights
- Standard binary search problem
- Use the guess() API: returns 0 if correct, 1 if too low, -1 if too high
- Narrow search space by half each iteration based on guess result

# Code
```javascript
/** 
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param {number} num   your guess
 * @return 	     -1 if num is higher than the picked number
 *			      1 if num is lower than the picked number
 *               otherwise return 0
 * var guess = function(num) {}
 */

/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var guessNumber = function(n) {
    if (n === 1) { return 1; }
    let left = 1, right = n;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        const guessResult = guess(mid);
        if (guessResult === 0) {
            return mid;
        }
        if (guessResult > 0) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    
    return -1;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(log n) - binary search
**Space:** O(1) - only using a few variables
