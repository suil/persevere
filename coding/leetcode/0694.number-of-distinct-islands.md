# Number of Distinct Islands
[694. Number of Distinct Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-distinct-islands/)

You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

# Key insights
- DFS from each unvisited land cell, recording the traversal path (direction + backtrack markers) as a signature string
- The path signature captures the shape of the island relative to its starting point, making congruent islands produce identical strings
- Store signatures in a Set to count distinct island shapes; backtrack markers ('B') are essential to distinguish different topologies

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @return {number}
 */
var numDistinctIslands = function(grid) {
    if (!grid || grid.length === 0) return 0;
    const m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
    const shapes = new Set();
    const dirs = [[-1,0,'U'], [1,0,'D'], [0,-1,'L'], [0,1,'R']];

    function dfs(x, y, path, dir) {
        grid[x][y] = 0;
        path.push(dir);
        for (const [dx, dy, move] of dirs) {
            const nx = x + dx, ny = y + dy;
            if (
                nx >= 0 && nx < m && ny >= 0 && ny < n &&
                grid[nx][ny] === 1
            ) {
                dfs(nx, ny, path, move);
            }
        }
        path.push('B'); // Backtrack marker
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 1) {
                const path = [];
                dfs(i, j, path, 'S'); // S=start
                shapes.add(path.join(','));
            }
        }
    }
    return shapes.size;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(m * n) -- each cell is visited at most once
**Space:** O(m * n) -- for the path signatures and the shapes set
