# Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer
[1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-binary-number-in-a-linked-list-to-integer/)

Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

The most significant bit is at the head of the linked list.

# Key insights
* Traverse the list from head to tail, building the number with bit shifting
* At each node, shift the current result left by 1 and OR with the current node's value
* This naturally handles the most-significant-bit-first ordering

# Code
```javascript
var getDecimalValue = function(head) {
    let res = 0;
    let curr = head;
    while (curr != null) {
        res = res * 2 + curr.val;
        curr = curr.next;
    }
    return res;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - Single traversal of the linked list where n is the number of nodes.
**Space:** O(1) - Only a constant amount of extra space is used for the result and pointer.
