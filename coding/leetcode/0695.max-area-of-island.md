# Max Area of Island
[695. Max Area of Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/)

You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

Example 1:
[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]

Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

# Key insights
* Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore connected land cells recursively
* Grid modification technique: mark visited cells as 0 to avoid revisiting
* Exhaustive search: iterate through every cell to find all possible islands
* Flood fill algorithm: calculate area by summing 1 + areas of all 4 neighbors

# Code
```javascript
var maxAreaOfIsland = function(grid) {
    let max = 0;
    for (let row = 0; row < grid.length; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col < grid[0].length; col++) {
            const area = maxAreaOfIslandHelper(grid, row, col);
            max = Math.max(max, area);
        }
    }
    return max;
};

function maxAreaOfIslandHelper(grid, row, col) {
    if (grid[row] === undefined
        || grid[row][col] === undefined
        || grid[row][col] === 0
    ) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    grid[row][col] = 0;
    
    return (1 +
        maxAreaOfIslandHelper(grid, row + 1, col) +
        maxAreaOfIslandHelper(grid, row - 1, col) +
        maxAreaOfIslandHelper(grid, row, col + 1) +
        maxAreaOfIslandHelper(grid, row, col - 1)
    );
}
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(m * n) - Each cell is visited at most once during DFS traversal, where m is rows and n is columns
**Space:** O(m * n) - In worst case (entire grid is one island), recursion depth can be m * n cells deep
