# Two Sum
[1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

# Key insights
* Use hash map for O(1) lookup of complement values
* Single pass algorithm - store and check simultaneously
* Calculate complement (target - current) instead of checking all pairs
* Trade space O(n) for time optimization from O(n²) to O(n)

# Code
```javascript
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
    const map = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        const remainder = target - nums[i];
        if (map.has(remainder)) {
            return [map.get(remainder), i];
        }
        map.set(nums[i], i);
    }
    return null;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - Single pass through the array with O(1) hash map operations
**Space:** O(n) - Hash map stores at most n key-value pairs in worst case
