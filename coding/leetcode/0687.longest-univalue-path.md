# Longest Univalue Path
[687. Longest Univalue Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-univalue-path/)

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the longest path, where each node in the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of the path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

Example 1:
        5
       / \
      4   5
     / \   \
    1   1   5
Input: root = [5,4,5,1,1,5]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,4,5,4,4,5]
Output: 2

# Key insights
* Post-order DFS traversal to process children before parent
* Global variable tracks maximum path while recursion returns single-direction path
* Reset path length to 0 when node values don't match for univalue constraint
* Each node considers both left+right paths for maximum but returns only one direction

# Code
```javascript
var longestUnivaluePath = function(root) {
    let count = 0;
    
    function longestUnivaluePathHelper(node) {
        if (!node) { return 0; }

        let leftCount = longestUnivaluePathHelper(node.left);
        let rightCount = longestUnivaluePathHelper(node.right);
        
        if (node.left && node.left.val === node.val) {
            leftCount++;
        } else {
            leftCount = 0;
        }
        
        if (node.right && node.right.val === node.val) {
            rightCount++;
        } else {
            rightCount = 0;
        }
        
        count = Math.max(count, leftCount + rightCount);
        return Math.max(leftCount, rightCount);
    }
    
    longestUnivaluePathHelper(root);
    return count;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - visits each node in the binary tree exactly once during the recursive traversal
**Space:** O(h) - uses recursive call stack space proportional to the height of the tree, where h can be O(log n) for balanced trees or O(n) for skewed trees
