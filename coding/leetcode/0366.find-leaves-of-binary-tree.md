# Find Leaves of Binary Tree
[366. Find Leaves of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-leaves-of-binary-tree/)

Given a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this: Collect and remove all leaves, repeat until the tree is empty.

Example:
Given binary tree
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
Returns [4, 5, 3], [2], [1].

# Key insights
* Iteratively remove leaf nodes level by level until tree is empty
* Use post-order traversal to identify and collect leaves in each iteration
* Remove leaves by returning null from recursive helper function
* Tree structure changes after each iteration, requiring multiple passes

# Code
```javascript
var findLeaves = function(root) {
    const result = [];
    while (root !== null) {
        const output = [];
        root = findLeavesHelper(root, output);
        result.push(output);
    }
    return result;
};
function findLeavesHelper(node, output) {
    if (node === null) { return null; }
    if (node.left === null && node.right === null) {
        output.push(node.val);
        return null;
    }
    
    node.left = findLeavesHelper(node.left, output);
    node.right = findLeavesHelper(node.right, output);
    return node;
}
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n²) - In worst case (skewed tree), we traverse the tree h times where h=n, resulting in n×n operations
**Space:** O(h) - Recursive call stack depth equals tree height h, plus O(n) for result storage
