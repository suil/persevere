### Random Pick with Weight
[528. Random Pick with Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/)

```html
You are given an array of positive integers w where w[i] describes the weight of ith index (0-indexed).

We need to call the function pickIndex() which randomly returns an integer in the range [0, w.length - 1]. pickIndex() should return the integer proportional to its weight in the w array. For example, for w = [1, 3], the probability of picking the index 0 is 1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25 (i.e 25%) while the probability of picking the index 1 is 3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75 (i.e 75%).

More formally, the probability of picking index i is w[i] / sum(w).

Example 1:
Input
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output
[null,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. Since there is only one single element on the array the only option is to return the first element.

Example 2:
Input
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output
[null,1,1,1,1,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 3]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1. It's returning the second element (index = 1) that has probability of 3/4.
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. It's returning the first element (index = 0) that has probability of 1/4.

Since this is a randomization problem, multiple answers are allowed so the following outputs can be considered correct :
[null,1,1,1,1,0]
[null,1,1,1,1,1]
[null,1,1,1,0,0]
[null,1,1,1,0,1]
[null,1,0,1,0,0]
......
and so on.

```javascript
var Solution = function(w) {
    this.accuSums = [];
    this.totalSum = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < w.length; i++) {
        this.totalSum += w[i];
        this.accuSums[i] = this.totalSum;
    }
};

/**
 * @return {number}
 */
Solution.prototype.pickIndex = function() {
    const target = this.totalSum * Math.random();
    // for (let i = 0; i < this.accuSums.length; ++i) {
    //     if (target < this.accuSums[i]) {
    //         return i;
    //     }
    // }
    let low = 0, high = this.accuSums.length - 1;
    while (low < high) {
        const mid = Math.floor(low + (high - low) / 2);
        if (this.accuSums[mid] > target) {
            high = mid;
        } else {
            low = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return low;
};
