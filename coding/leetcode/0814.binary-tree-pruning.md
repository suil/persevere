# Binary Tree Pruning
[814. Binary Tree Pruning](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-pruning/)

We are given the head node root of a binary tree, where additionally every node's value is either a 0 or a 1.

Return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a 1 has been removed.

(Recall that the subtree of a node X is X, plus every node that is a descendant of X.)

Example 1:
Input: [1,null,0,0,1]
Output: [1,null,0,null,1]
 
Explanation: 
Only the red nodes satisfy the property "every subtree not containing a 1".
The diagram on the right represents the answer.
    1              1
     \              \
      0      =>      0
     / \              \
   (0)  1              1

Example 2:
Input: [1,0,1,0,0,0,1]
Output: [1,null,1,null,1]
      __1__              1
     /     \              \  
   (0)      1       =>     1
   / \     / \              \
 (0) (0) (0)  1              1

Example 3:
Input: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0]
Output: [1,1,0,1,1,null,1]

      __1__              1
     /     \           /   \  
    1       0     =>  1     0
   / \     / \       / \     \
  1   1  (0)  1     1   1     1
 /
(0)

Note:

The binary tree will have at most 200 nodes.
The value of each node will only be 0 or 1.

# Key insights
* Post-order traversal processes children before parent for bottom-up pruning
* Recursive approach naturally handles subtree pruning in single pass
* Node kept only if it's 1 or has remaining children after pruning
* Base case removes leaf nodes with value 0, enabling cascading removals

# Code
```javascript
var pruneTree = function(root) {
    if (root === null) { return null; }
    if (root.left === null && root.right === null && root.val === 0) {
        return null;
    }
    root.left = pruneTree(root.left);
    root.right = pruneTree(root.right);
    return (root.val === 1 || root.left || root.right) ? root : null;
}
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - visits each node exactly once to determine if it should be pruned
**Space:** O(h) - uses recursion stack space proportional to the height of the tree, where h is the tree height
