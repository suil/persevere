# Maximize Distance to Closest Person
[849. Maximize Distance to Closest Person](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-distance-to-closest-person/)

You are given an array representing a row of seats where seats[i] = 1 represents a person sitting in the ith seat, and seats[i] = 0 represents that the ith seat is empty (0-indexed).

# Key insights
- Collect indices of all occupied seats, then check three cases: gap at the start, gaps between occupied seats, and gap at the end
- For a gap between two occupied people, the best seat is in the middle giving distance floor(gap/2)
- Edge gaps (start and end of row) give full distance since you can sit at the boundary

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} seats
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxDistToClosest = function(seats) {
    const occupied = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < seats.length; i++) {
        if (seats[i] === 1) occupied.push(i);
    }

    let maxDist = occupied[0];

    for (let i = 0; i < occupied.length - 1; i++) {
        const curr = occupied[i];
        const next = occupied[i + 1];
        const dist = next - curr;
        
        maxDist = Math.max(maxDist, Math.floor(dist / 2));
    }

    maxDist = Math.max(maxDist, seats.length - 1 - occupied[occupied.length - 1]);
    return maxDist;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n)**Space:** O(k) where k is the number of occupied seats
