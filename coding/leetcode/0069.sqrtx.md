# Sqrt(x)
[69. Sqrt(x)](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/)

Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Example 1:
Input: x = 4
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.

# Key insights
* Binary search to find largest integer whose square ≤ x
* Search space optimized from [1, x/2] since √x ≤ x/2 for x > 1
* Return 'high' pointer as it holds the floor of the square root
* O(log x) time complexity by halving search space each iteration

# Code
```javascript
var mySqrt = function(x) {
    if (x <= 1) {
        return x;
    }

    let low = 1, high = Math.floor(x / 2);
    while (low <= high) {
        const mid = Math.floor(low + (high - low) / 2);
        const square = mid * mid;
        
        if (square > x) {
            high = mid - 1;
        } else {
            low = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return high;
};
