# Queue Reconstruction by Height
[406. Queue Reconstruction by Height](https://leetcode.com/problems/queue-reconstruction-by-height/)

You are given an array of people, people, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each people[i] = [hi, ki] represents the ith person of height hi with exactly ki other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to hi.

# Key insights
- Sort by height descending, then by k ascending
- Insert each person at position k in the result array
- Taller people are placed first, so their positions won't be affected by shorter people
- When inserting shorter people, k correctly represents how many taller people are in front

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} people
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var reconstructQueue = function(people) {
    people.sort((a, b) => {
        if (a[0] > b[0]) return -1;
        if (a[0] < b[0]) return 1;
        return a[1] - b[1];
    });
    
    const res = [];
    for (const [h, k] of people) {
        res.splice(k, 0, [h, k]);
    }
    return res;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n^2) - sorting is O(n log n), but each splice is O(n) for n insertions
**Space:** O(n) - for the result array
