# Maximum Distance in Arrays
[624. Maximum Distance in Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-distance-in-arrays/)

You are given m arrays, where each array is sorted in ascending order.

# Key insights
- Track the global min and max seen so far while iterating through arrays; for each new array, compute distance using its max against global min and its min against global max
- This ensures the two values come from different arrays since we compare the current array against previously seen extremes
- Update global min and max after computing distances for the current array

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} arrays
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxDistance = function(arrays) {
    let max = arrays[0].at(-1);
    let min = arrays[0][0];
    let res = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i < arrays.length; i++) {
        const arr = arrays[i];
        const currMin = arr[0];
        const currMax = arr.at(-1);

        res = Math.max(res, Math.abs(currMax - min), Math.abs(currMin - max));

        max = Math.max(max, currMax);
        min = Math.min(min, currMin);
    }

    return res;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(m) where m is the number of arrays -- single pass
**Space:** O(1)
