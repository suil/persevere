### Number of Provinces
[547. Number of Provinces](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/)

```html
There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

Return the total number of provinces.

Example 1:

Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3
```

```javascript
var findCircleNum = function(isConnected) {
    let count = 0;
    const visited = Array(isConnected.length).fill(false);
    for (let i = 0; i < isConnected.length; i++) {
        if (!visited[i]) {
            findCircleNumHelper(isConnected, i, visited);
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
};

function findCircleNumHelper(isConnected, start, visited) {
    if (isConnected[start] === undefined || visited[start]) {
        return 0;
    }

    visited[start] = true;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < isConnected.length; i++) {
        if (isConnected[start][i] === 1 && !visited[i]) {
            findCircleNumHelper(isConnected, i, visited);
        }
    }
}
