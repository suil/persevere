# Flatten Nested List Iterator
[341. Flatten Nested List Iterator](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-nested-list-iterator/)

You are given a nested list of integers nestedList. Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists. Implement an iterator to flatten it.

Implement the NestedIterator class:

NestedIterator(List<NestedInteger> nestedList) Initializes the iterator with the nested list nestedList.
int next() Returns the next integer in the nested list.
boolean hasNext() Returns true if there are still some integers in the nested list and false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: nestedList = [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: [1,1,2,1,1]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,1,2,1,1].
Example 2:

Input: nestedList = [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: [1,4,6]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,4,6].

# Key insights
* Pre-flatten entire nested structure using recursive DFS traversal
* Use array shift() for iterator next() to maintain FIFO order
* Trade space for time - O(n) preprocessing enables O(1) hasNext() calls
* Recursive approach handles arbitrary nesting depth naturally

# Code
```javascript
var NestedIterator = function(nestedList) {
    function flattern(list) {
        if (!list) {
            return [];
        }
        let flattenedList = [];
        for (const item of list) {
            if (item.isInteger()) {
                flattenedList.push(item.getInteger());
            } else {
                flattenedList = [...flattenedList, ...flattern(item.getList())];
            }
        }
        return flattenedList;
    }
    this.flattenedList = flattern(nestedList);
};
NestedIterator.prototype.hasNext = function() {
    return this.flattenedList.length > 0;
};
NestedIterator.prototype.next = function() {
    return this.flattenedList.shift();
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(N) - We visit each integer exactly once during the flattening process in the constructor, and each next() call takes O(N) time due to shift() operation which moves all remaining elements.

**Space:** O(N + D) - We store all N integers in the flattened list, plus O(D) space for the recursion stack where D is the maximum nesting depth.
