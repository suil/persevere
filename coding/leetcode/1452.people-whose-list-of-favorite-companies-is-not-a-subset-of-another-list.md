# People Whose List of Favorite Companies Is Not a Subset of Another List
[1452. People Whose List of Favorite Companies Is Not a Subset of Another List](https://leetcode.com/problems/people-whose-list-of-favorite-companies-is-not-a-subset-of-another-list/)

Given the array favoriteCompanies where favoriteCompanies[i] is the list of favorites companies for the ith person (indexed from 0).

# Key insights
- For each person, check if their company list is a subset of any other person's list using brute force pairwise comparison
- Early termination: skip subset check if the candidate list is longer than the comparison list
- Convert the comparison list to a Set for O(1) membership checks during the subset test

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[][]} favoriteCompanies
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var peopleIndexes = function(favoriteCompanies) {
    function isSubsetOf(set1, set2) {
        if (set1.length > set2.length) {
            return false;
        }

        const set2Set = new Set(set2);
        for (const company of set1) {
            if (!set2Set.has(company)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    const result = [];
    const n = favoriteCompanies.length;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let isSubset = false;
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i === j) continue;
            if (isSubsetOf(favoriteCompanies[i], favoriteCompanies[j])) {
                isSubset = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!isSubset) {
            result.push(i);
        }
    }

    return result;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n^2 * m) where n is the number of people and m is the max list length
**Space:** O(m) for the Set created during each subset check
