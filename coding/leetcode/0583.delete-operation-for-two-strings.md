# Delete Operation for Two Strings
[583. Delete Operation for Two Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-operation-for-two-strings/)

Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of steps required to make word1 and word2 the same.

In one step, you can delete exactly one character in either string.

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "sea", word2 = "eat"
Output: 2
Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "leetcode", word2 = "etco"
Output: 4

# Key insights
* Uses 2D DP to find Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between the two strings
* Characters match: extend LCS by 1; no match: take maximum from adjacent cells
* Converts LCS problem to deletion count: total_length - 2*LCS_length
* O(m*n) time and space complexity using bottom-up dynamic programming approach

# Code
```javascript
var minDistance = function(word1, word2) {
    const len1 = word1.length;
    const len2 = word2.length;
    
    const dp = [...Array(len1 + 1)].map(_ => [...Array(len2 + 1)].fill(0));
    for (let i = 1; i <= len1; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= len2; j++) {
            if (word1[i - 1] === word2[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return len1 + len2 - 2 * dp[len1][len2];
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(len1 * len2) - nested loops iterate through all combinations of characters from both strings to fill the DP table
**Space:** O(len1 * len2) - 2D DP array of size (len1 + 1) × (len2 + 1) is created to store intermediate results
