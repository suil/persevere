# Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination
[1293. Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-a-grid-with-obstacles-elimination/)

You are given an m x n integer matrix grid where each cell is either 0 (empty) or 1 (obstacle). You can move up, down, left, or right from and to an empty cell in one step.

# Key insights
- BFS with state (row, col, wallsUsed) to find the shortest path allowing up to k obstacle eliminations
- Visited set includes the wall count in the key to allow revisiting a cell with fewer walls used
- Level-by-level BFS ensures the first time we reach the destination is the shortest path

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var shortestPath = function(grid, k) {
    
    const DIRECTIONS = [[0, 1], [0, -1], [-1, 0], [1, 0]]
    const visited = new Set();
    visited.add('0-0-0');

    let queue = [[0, 0, 0, 0]];
    let steps = -1;
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const nextQueue = [];
        steps++;

        for (const [row, col, wallUsed] of queue) {
            if (row === grid.length - 1 && col === grid[0].length - 1) return steps;
            for (const [dRow, dCol] of DIRECTIONS) {
                const nextRow = row + dRow;
                const nextCol = col + dCol;
                if (grid[nextRow]?.[nextCol] === undefined) continue;

                const nextWallUsed = wallUsed + grid[nextRow][nextCol];
                if (visited.has(`${nextRow}-${nextCol}-${nextWallUsed}`)) continue;

                if (nextWallUsed <= k) {
                    visited.add(`${nextRow}-${nextCol}-${nextWallUsed}`);
                    nextQueue.push([nextRow, nextCol, nextWallUsed]);
                }
            }
        }
        queue = nextQueue;
    }

    return -1;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(m * n * k) -- each cell can be visited with up to k different wall-used counts
**Space:** O(m * n * k) -- for the visited set and queue
