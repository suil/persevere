# Merge Two Sorted Lists
[21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/0021.merge-two-sorted-lists.md)

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Example 1:

1 -> 2 -> 4
1 -> 3 -> 4
1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4

Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
Example 2:

Input: l1 = [], l2 = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]

# Key insights
* Use recursive divide-and-conquer to break problem into smaller subproblems
* Base cases handle null lists by returning the non-null list
* Compare heads of both lists and recursively merge remaining nodes
* Creates new nodes instead of reusing existing ones (space: O(m+n))

# Code
```javascript
var mergeTwoLists = function(l1, l2) {
    if (l1 === null) { return l2; }
    if (l2 === null) { return l1; }
    
    const newList = new ListNode();
    if (l1.val < l2.val) {
        newList.val = l1.val;
        newList.next = mergeTwoLists(l1.next, l2);
    } else {
        newList.val = l2.val;
        newList.next = mergeTwoLists(l1, l2.next);
    }
    return newList;
};
