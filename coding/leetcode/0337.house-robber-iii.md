# House Robber III
[337. House Robber III](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iii/)

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called root.

Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Given the root of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police.

Example 1:

     3
    / \
   2   3
    \   \
     3   1

Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
Output: 7
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.

Example 2:

        3
      /   \
     4     5
    / \     \
   1   3     1

Input: root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]
Output: 9
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.

# Key insights
* Bottom-up dynamic programming on binary tree using post-order traversal
* Track two states per node: maximum profit when robbed vs not robbed
* Single pass O(n) time by computing subproblem results once per node
* Return both states upward to enable optimal decision making at parent nodes

# Code
```javascript
var rob = function(root) {
    if (!root) { return 0; }
    const { robbed, notRobbed } = robHelper(root);
    return Math.max(robbed, notRobbed);
};

function robHelper(node) {
    if (!node) {
        return { robbed: 0, notRobbed: 0 };
    }

    const leftRob = robHelper(node.left);
    const rightRob = robHelper(node.right);
    
    const robbed = node.val + leftRob.notRobbed + rightRob.notRobbed;
    const notRobbed = Math.max(leftRob.robbed, leftRob.notRobbed) + Math.max(rightRob.robbed, rightRob.notRobbed);
    return { robbed, notRobbed };
}
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - visits each node exactly once in the binary tree where n is the number of nodes
**Space:** O(h) - uses recursion stack space proportional to the height h of the tree, plus constant space for return objects
