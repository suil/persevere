# Find Common Characters
[1002. Find Common Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-common-characters/)

Given a string array words, return an array of all characters that show up in all strings within the words (including duplicates). You may return the answer in any order.

# Key insights
- Builds a frequency map from the first word, then intersects it with each subsequent word by taking the minimum count per character
- After processing all words, the map contains the minimum frequency of each character common to all words
- Expands the final map into a result array, repeating each character by its count

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var commonChars = function(words) {
  const map = new Map()

  for (let str of words[0]) {
    map.set(str, ((map.get(str) || 0) + 1))
  }

  for (let i = 1; i < words.length; i++) {
    let map2 = new Map();
    for (let str of words[i]) {
      map2.set(str, (map2.get(str) || 0) + 1)
    }
    for (const [letter] of map) {
      map.set(letter, Math.min((map.get(letter) || 0), (map2.get(letter) || 0)));
    }
  }

  let res = [];
  for (const [letter, count] of map) {
    for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        res.push(letter)
    }
  }

  return res;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n * m) -- where n is the number of words and m is the average word length
**Space:** O(1) -- frequency maps are bounded by 26 lowercase letters
