# Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree
[108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/)

Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.

A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
Explanation: [0,-10,5,null,-3,null,9] is also accepted:

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3]
Output: [3,1]
Explanation: [1,3] and [3,1] are both a height-balanced BSTs.

# Key insights
* Use divide-and-conquer recursion to split array at midpoint
* Middle element becomes root to ensure balanced BST structure
* Recursively build left subtree from left half, right from right half
* Base case returns null when subarray is empty

# Code
```javascript
var sortedArrayToBST = function(nums) {
    if (nums.length === 0) {
        return null
    }
    const midIndex = Math.floor(nums.length / 2);
    const leftTree = sortedArrayToBST(nums.slice(0, midIndex));
    const rightTree = sortedArrayToBST(nums.slice(midIndex + 1));
    return new TreeNode(nums[midIndex], leftTree, rightTree);
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n log n) - Each of the n nodes is created once, but array slicing at each recursive call takes O(n) time in the worst case, and there are O(log n) levels of recursion.

**Space:** O(n log n) - The recursion stack has O(log n) depth, but at each level, array slicing creates new arrays that collectively store O(n) elements, resulting in O(n log n) auxiliary space plus O(n) for the output tree.
