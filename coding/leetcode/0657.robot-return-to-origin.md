# Robot Return to Origin
[657. Robot Return to Origin](https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-return-to-origin/)

There is a robot starting at the position (0, 0), the origin, on a 2D plane. Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot ends up at (0, 0) after it completes its moves.

# Key insights
- Track the robot's position with x and y coordinates; each move increments or decrements one coordinate
- The robot returns to origin if and only if both x and y are 0 after processing all moves (L cancels R, U cancels D)

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} moves
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var judgeCircle = function(moves) {
    let x = 0, y = 0;
    for (const move of moves) {
        switch (move) {
            case 'U': y--; break;
            case 'D': y++; break;
            case 'L': x--; break;
            case 'R': x++; break;
        }
    }
    return x === 0 && y === 0;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) -- single pass through the moves string
**Space:** O(1)
