# Longest Palindromic Substring
[5. Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring)

Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

Example 1:

Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consist of only digits and English letters.

# Key insights
* Expand around center approach - check palindromes by growing outward from each position
* Handle both odd and even length palindromes by using different center configurations
* Two pointers technique expanding left and right simultaneously until mismatch found
* O(n²) time complexity with O(1) space - more efficient than dynamic programming approach

# Code
```javascript
var longestPalindrome = function(s) {
    function expand(left, right) {
        while (left >= 0 && right < s.length && s[left] === s[right]) {
            left--;
            right++;
        }
        return s.substring(left + 1, right);
    }

    let res = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        const res1 = expand(i, i);
        if (res1.length > res.length) {
            res = res1;
        }

        const res2 = expand(i, i + 1);
        if (res2.length > res.length) {
            res = res2;
        }
    }

    return res;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n²) - For each of the n possible centers, we expand outward up to n/2 positions in the worst case

**Space:** O(1) - Only uses a constant amount of extra variables regardless of input size
