# Island Perimeter
[463. Island Perimeter](https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/)

You are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1 represents land and grid[i][j] = 0 represents water.

# Key insights
- For each land cell, check all four neighbors; each edge adjacent to water or the grid boundary contributes 1 to the perimeter
- No need for DFS/BFS since we can simply iterate through every cell and count exposed edges

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @return {number}
 */
var islandPerimeter = function(grid) {
    let rowLen = grid.length;
    let colLen = grid[0].length;
    let count = 0;

    for (let row = 0; row < rowLen; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col < colLen; col++) {
            if (grid[row][col] === 1) {
                if (grid[row]?.[col - 1] === 0 || col === 0)
                    count++;

                if (grid[row - 1]?.[col] === 0 || row === 0)
                    count++;

                if (grid[row]?.[col + 1] === 0 || col === colLen - 1)
                    count++;

                if (grid[row + 1]?.[col] === 0 || row === rowLen - 1)
                    count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(m * n) -- visit every cell in the grid
**Space:** O(1)
