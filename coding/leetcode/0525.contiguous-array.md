# Contiguous Array
[525. Contiguous Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/contiguous-array/)

Given a binary array nums, return the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,0] is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
 

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.

# Key insights
- Transform the problem: treat 0 as -1, so equal 0s and 1s will have sum = 0
- Use prefix sum technique: if two indices have the same sum, the subarray between them has sum 0 (equal 0s and 1s)
- Hash map stores the first occurrence of each sum value
- Initialize map with sum 0 at index -1 to handle subarrays starting from index 0
- When we encounter a sum we've seen before, the distance between current index and first occurrence is a valid subarray length

# Code
```javascript
var findMaxLength = function(nums) {
    const firstIndex = new Map();
    firstIndex.set(0, -1);
    let sum = 0;
    let maxLen = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        sum += nums[i] === 1 ? 1 : -1;

        if (firstIndex.has(sum)) {
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, i - firstIndex.get(sum))
        } else {
            firstIndex.set(sum, i);
        }
    }
    return maxLen;
};
```

# Complexity
- Time: O(n) - single pass through the array
- Space: O(n) - hash map can store up to n different sum values in worst case
