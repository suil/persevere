### Evaluate Division
[399. Evaluate Division](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-division/)

```html
You are given an array of variable pairs equations and an array of real numbers values, where equations[i] = [Ai, Bi] and values[i] represent the equation Ai / Bi = values[i]. Each Ai or Bi is a string that represents a single variable.

You are also given some queries, where queries[j] = [Cj, Dj] represents the jth query where you must find the answer for Cj / Dj = ?.

Return the answers to all queries. If a single answer cannot be determined, return -1.0.

Note: The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.

Example 1:

Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]
Output: [6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]
Explanation: 
Given: a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0
queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ?
return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ]

Example 2:

Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["bc","cd"]], values = [1.5,2.5,5.0], queries = [["a","c"],["c","b"],["bc","cd"],["cd","bc"]]
Output: [3.75000,0.40000,5.00000,0.20000]
Example 3:

Input: equations = [["a","b"]], values = [0.5], queries = [["a","b"],["b","a"],["a","c"],["x","y"]]
Output: [0.50000,2.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000]
```

```javascript
var calcEquation = function(equations, values, queries) {
    const graph = {};
    for (let i = 0; i < equations.length; i++) {
        const [u, v] = equations[i];
        const value = values[i];
        if (!graph[u]) { graph [u] = {}; }
        if (!graph[v]) { graph [v] = {}; }
        graph[u][v] = value;
        graph[v][u] = 1 / value;
    }

    const dfs = (x, y, visited) => {
        
        // If either key does not exist, there is no correlation
        if (!graph[x] || !graph[y]) { return -1; }
        
        // No traversing is necessary, there is a direct path
        if (y in graph[x]) { return graph[x][y]; }
        
        for (let key in graph[x]) {
            if (visited.has(key)) { continue; }
            visited.add(key);

            const current = dfs(key, y, visited);
            if (current !== -1) { return graph[x][key] * current; }
        }
        return -1;
    };

    return queries.map(query => dfs(query[0], query[1], new Set()));
};
