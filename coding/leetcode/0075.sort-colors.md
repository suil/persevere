# Sort Colors
[75. Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]

Example 4:
Input: nums = [1]
Output: [1]

# Key insights
* Dutch National Flag algorithm using three pointers to partition array in single pass
* Move 0s to left, 2s to right, leaving 1s naturally in middle section
* Don't increment index when swapping with high pointer since new element needs checking
* In-place sorting achieving O(n) time and O(1) space complexity

# Code
```javascript
var sortColors = function(nums) {
    let low = 0;
    let high = nums.length - 1;
    let index = 0;

    while (index <= high) {
        if (nums[index] == 0) {
            [nums[low], nums[index]] = [nums[index], nums[low]];
            index++;
            low++;
        } else if (nums[index] == 2) {
            [nums[index], nums[high]] = [nums[high], nums[index]];
            high--;
        } else {
            index++;
        }
    }
};
