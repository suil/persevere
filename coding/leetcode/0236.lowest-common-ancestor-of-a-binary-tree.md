# Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
[236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 5 and 1 is 3. Another example is LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

# Key insights
* Uses post-order traversal to search bottom-up for target nodes
* Base case returns node if it matches p, q, or is null
* LCA is found when both left and right subtrees return non-null values
* Returns first found target node when only one subtree contains a target

# Code
```javascript
var lowestCommonAncestor = function(root, p, q) {
    if (root === null || root === p || root === q) {
        return root
    }
    const left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
    const right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
    if (left && right) {
        return root
    }
    return left || right
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - visits each node in the binary tree at most once during the recursive traversal
**Space:** O(h) - uses recursion stack space proportional to the height of the tree, where h is the height
