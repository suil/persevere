# Gas Station
[134. Gas Station](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/)

There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].

# Key insights
- If total gas < total cost, no solution exists; otherwise exactly one solution is guaranteed
- Greedy: track running gas surplus; when it drops below 0, reset surplus and move the start to the next station
- Any station that causes a deficit cannot be the start, and the answer must be after the last deficit

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} gas
 * @param {number[]} cost
 * @return {number}
 */
var canCompleteCircuit = function(gas, cost) {
    const totalGas = gas.reduce((s, g) => s + g, 0);
    const totalCost = cost.reduce((s, c) => s + c, 0);
    if (totalGas < totalCost) {
        return -1;
    }

    let gasLeft = 0;
    let start = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < gas.length; i++) {
        gasLeft += gas[i] - cost[i];
        if (gasLeft < 0) {
            gasLeft = 0;
            start = i + 1;
        }
    }
    return start;    
};
```
