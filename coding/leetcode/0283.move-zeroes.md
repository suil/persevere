# Move Zeroes
[283. Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/description/)

Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]

# Key insights
* Two-pointer technique with write pointer to maintain relative order
* Single pass to collect non-zero elements, then fill remaining with zeros
* In-place modification achieves O(1) space complexity
* Stable partitioning preserves original order of non-zero elements

# Code
```javascript
var moveZeroes = function(nums) {
    let idx = 0;
    for (const num of nums) {
        if (num != 0) {
            nums[idx++] = num;
        }
    }
    while (idx < nums.length) {
        nums[idx++] = 0;
    }
};
```
