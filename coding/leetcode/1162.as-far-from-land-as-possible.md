### As Far from Land as Possible
[1162. As Far from Land as Possible](https://leetcode.com/problems/as-far-from-land-as-possible/)

```html
Given an n x n grid containing only values 0 and 1, where 0 represents water and 1 represents land, find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized, and return the distance. If no land or water exists in the grid, return -1.

The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance: the distance between two cells (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) is |x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|.

Example 1:


Input: grid = [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The cell (1, 1) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 2.
Example 2:


Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The cell (2, 2) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 4.

```javascript
const dir = [[-1, 0], [1, 0], [0,-1], [0, 1]];
var maxDistance = function(grid) {
    let ret = 0;
    let queue = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
        for(let j = 0; j < grid.length; j++){
            if (grid[i][j] === 1) {
                queue.push([i, j]);
            }
        }
    }

    let step = 0;
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        ret = Math.max(ret, (step++));
        const nextQueue = [];

        for (const [row, col] of queue) {
            for(const [deltaRow, deltaCol] of dir) {
                const nextRow = row + deltaRow, nextCol = col + deltaCol;
                if (grid[nextRow] !== undefined && grid[nextRow][nextCol] === 0) {
                    grid[nextRow][nextCol] = -1;
                    nextQueue.push([nextRow, nextCol]);
                }
            }
        }
        queue = nextQueue;
    }
    return ret === 0 ? -1 : ret;
};
