# Available Captures for Rook
[999. Available Captures for Rook](https://leetcode.com/problems/available-captures-for-rook/)

You are given an 8 x 8 matrix representing a chessboard. There is exactly one white rook represented by 'R', some number of white bishops 'B', and some number of black pawns 'p'. Empty squares are represented by '.'.

# Key insights
- Locates the rook on the 8x8 board, then scans in all four cardinal directions
- In each direction, stops at the first piece encountered: captures a pawn ('p') or is blocked by a bishop ('B')
- Board size is fixed at 8x8, so the search is bounded

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {character[][]} board
 * @return {number}
 */
var numRookCaptures = function(board) {
    let rookRow = -1, rookCol = -1;
    // Find position of the rook
    for (let r = 0; r < 8; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < 8; c++) {
            if (board[r][c] === 'R') {
                rookRow = r;
                rookCol = c;
            }
        }
    }

    let captures = 0;
    // Four directions: up, down, left, right
    const dirs = [[-1,0], [1,0], [0,-1], [0,1]];

    for (const [dr, dc] of dirs) {
        let r = rookRow, c = rookCol;
        while (true) {
            r += dr;
            c += dc;
            if (r < 0 || r >= 8 || c < 0 || c >= 8) break;
            if (board[r][c] === 'B') break; // bishop blocks
            if (board[r][c] === 'p') {
                captures++;
                break; // can only capture first pawn in direction
            }
        }
    }
    return captures;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(1) -- board is always 8x8, so all operations are bounded by a constant
**Space:** O(1) -- only a few variables used
