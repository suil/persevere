# Nested List Weight Sum II
[364. Nested List Weight Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/nested-list-weight-sum-ii/)

Given a nested list of integers, return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

Different from the previous question where weight is increasing from root to leaf, now the weight is defined from bottom up. i.e., the leaf level integers have weight 1, and the root level integers have the largest weight.

Example 1: Given the list [[1,1],2,[1,1]], return 8. (four 1's at depth 1, one 2 at depth 2)

Example 2: Given the list [1,[4,[6]]], return 17. (one 1 at depth 3, one 4 at depth 2, and one 6 at depth 1; 1*3 + 4*2 + 6*1 = 17)

# Key insights
* Use DFS recursion to group integers by depth level in a 2D array
* Reverse weight calculation: deepest level gets weight 1, shallowest gets max weight
* Two-phase approach: first flatten by depth, then calculate weighted sum in reverse
* Avoid computing actual max depth by using flattened array length as starting weight

# Code
```javascript
var depthSumInverse = function(nestedList) {
    const flattened = [];
    helper(nestedList, 0, flattened);
    
    let weight = flattened.length, sum = 0;
    for (const item of flattened) {
        for (let i = 0; i < item.length; i++) {
            sum += item[i] * weight;
        }
        weight--;
    }
    return sum;
};
function helper(nestedList, depth, flattened) {
    if (!flattened[depth]) { flattened[depth] = []; }
    
    for (const item of nestedList) {
        if (item.isInteger()) {
            flattened[depth].push(item.getInteger());
        } else {
            helper(item.getList(), depth + 1, flattened);
        }
    }
}
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(N) - visits each element once during traversal, then iterates through all elements again for sum calculation
**Space:** O(N + D) - stores all N integers in flattened array plus O(D) recursion stack depth where D is maximum nesting depth
