### Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
[153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

```html
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.
```

```javascript
var findMin = function(nums) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;
    let min = Infinity;

    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);

        if (nums[mid] >= nums[left]) {
            min = Math.min(min, nums[left]);
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            min = Math.min(min, nums[mid]);
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return min
};
