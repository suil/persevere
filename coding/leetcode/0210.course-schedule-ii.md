# Course Schedule II
[210. Course Schedule II](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/description/)

There are a total of n courses you have to take labelled from 0 to n - 1.
Some courses may have prerequisites, for example, if prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] this means you must take the course bi before the course ai.
Given the total number of courses numCourses and a list of the prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.
If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.
Example 1:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
Example 2:

Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].
Example 3:

Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
Output: [0]

# Key insights
* Uses DFS-based topological sort to detect cycles and find valid course ordering
* Maintains 'visiting' and 'visited' arrays to detect back edges indicating cycles
* Builds reverse dependency graph where each course points to its prerequisites
* Adds courses to result during DFS backtracking to ensure dependencies come first

# Code
```javascript
var findOrder = function(numCourses, prerequisites) {
    const graph = [...Array(numCourses)].map(_ => []);
    for (const [course, dependency] of prerequisites) {
        if (!graph[course]) {
            graph[course] = [];
        }
        graph[course].push(dependency);
    }

    const visited = [];
    const visiting = [];
    const orders = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
        if (hasCircle(graph, i, visited, visiting, orders)) {
            return [];
        }
    }
    
    return orders;
};

function hasCircle(graph, current, visited, visiting, orders) {
    if (visited[current]) {
        return false;
    }
    
    if (visiting[current]) {
        return true;
    }
    
    visiting[current] = true;
    
    for (const neighbor of graph[current]) {
        if (hasCircle(graph, neighbor, visited, visiting, orders)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    
    visiting[current] = false;
    visited[current] = true;
    orders.push(current);
    return false;
}
```
