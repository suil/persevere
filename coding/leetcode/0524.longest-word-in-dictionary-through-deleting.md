# Longest Word in Dictionary through Deleting
[524. Longest Word in Dictionary through Deleting](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-word-in-dictionary-through-deleting/)

Given a string s and a string array dictionary, return the longest string in the dictionary that can be formed by deleting some of the given string characters. If there is more than one possible result, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no possible result, return the empty string.

# Key insights
- Use a two-pointer subsequence check: advance through s and the dictionary word simultaneously, matching characters greedily
- For each dictionary word that is a subsequence of s, track the longest one (breaking ties by lexicographic order)
- No sorting needed; a single pass through the dictionary with the match function suffices

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string[]} dictionary
 * @return {string}
 */
var findLongestWord = function(s, dictionary) {
    
    function match(s, t) {
        let pt = 0;

        for (let ps = 0; ps < s.length; ps++) {
            if (s[ps] === t[pt]) {
                pt++;
            }
        }
        return pt === t.length;
    }

    let res = '';
    for (const word of dictionary) {
        if (match(s, word)) {
            if (res.length < word.length) {
                res = word;
            } else if (res.length === word.length) {
                res = res > word ? word : res;
            }
        }
    }
    return res;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(d * s) where d is the number of dictionary words and s is the length of the string
**Space:** O(1) -- only pointers and a result variable (excluding output)
