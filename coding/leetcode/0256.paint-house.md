### Paint House
[256. Paint House](https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-house/)
```html
There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red;costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

Note: All costs are positive integers.

Memoization (top down)

```javascript
function minCostMemoization(costs, currentIndex, lastColorIndex, memo) {
    if (memo.has(`${currentIndex}:${lastColorIndex}`)) {
        return memo.get(`${currentIndex}:${lastColorIndex}`);
    }
    
    if (currentIndex >= costs.length) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    let min = Infinity;
    for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        if (lastColorIndex === i) {
            continue;
        }
        min = Math.min(min, costs[currentIndex][i] + minCostMemoization(costs, currentIndex + 1, i, memo));
    }
    memo.set(`${currentIndex}:${lastColorIndex}`, min)
    return min;
}
```

```javascript
function minCostDP(costs) {
    if (costs === null || costs.length === 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    let n = costs.length;
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        costs[i][0] += Math.min(costs[i - 1][1], costs[i - 1][2]);
        costs[i][1] += Math.min(costs[i - 1][0], costs[i - 1][2]);
        costs[i][2] += Math.min(costs[i - 1][0], costs[i - 1][1]);
    }
    return Math.min(costs[n - 1][0], costs[n - 1][1], costs[n - 1][2]);
}
```
