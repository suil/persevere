# Convert to Base -2
[1017. Convert to Base -2](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-to-base-2/)

Given an integer n, return a binary string representing its representation in base -2.

# Key insights
- Converts to base -2 (negabinary) by repeatedly dividing by -2 and collecting remainders
- When the remainder is negative, adjusts by adding 2 to the remainder and incrementing the quotient to keep digits valid (0 or 1)
- Uses BigInt arithmetic for precision during the conversion

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {string}
 */
var baseNeg2 = function(n) {
    const ToNegabinary = (num) => {
        let res = '';
        while (num != 0n) {
            let remainder = num % -2n;
            num /= -2n;
            if (remainder < 0n) {
                remainder += 2n;
                num++;
            }
            res = remainder.toString() + res;
        }
        return res.length == 0n ? '0' : res;
    };

    return ToNegabinary(BigInt(n));
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(log n) -- the number is divided by 2 each iteration
**Space:** O(log n) -- for the resulting string
