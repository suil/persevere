### Flower Planting With No Adjacent
[1042. Flower Planting With No Adjacent](https://leetcode.com/problems/flower-planting-with-no-adjacent/)

```html
You have n gardens, labeled from 1 to n, and an array paths where paths[i] = [xi, yi] describes a bidirectional path between garden xi to garden yi. In each garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers.

All gardens have at most 3 paths coming into or leaving it.

Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.

Return any such a choice as an array answer, where answer[i] is the type of flower planted in the (i+1)th garden. The flower types are denoted 1, 2, 3, or 4. It is guaranteed an answer exists.

Example 1:
Input: n = 3, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation:
Gardens 1 and 2 have different types.
Gardens 2 and 3 have different types.
Gardens 3 and 1 have different types.
Hence, [1,2,3] is a valid answer. Other valid answers include [1,2,4], [1,4,2], and [3,2,1].

Example 2:
Input: n = 4, paths = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: [1,2,1,2]
Example 3:

Input: n = 4, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

```javascript
var gardenNoAdj = function(n, paths) {
    const graph = [...Array(n)].map(() => []);
    for (const [u, v] of paths) {
        graph[u - 1].push(v - 1);
        graph[v - 1].push(u - 1);
    }
    
    const ans = [];
    for (let u = 0; u < n; u++) {
        const neighbors = graph[u];
        const usedColors = new Set();
        for (const neighbor of neighbors) {
            if (ans[neighbor]) { usedColors.add(ans[neighbor]); }
        }
        for (const color of [1, 2, 3, 4]) {
            if (!usedColors.has(color)) {
                ans[u] = color;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return ans;
};
