# Insert into a Sorted Circular Linked List
[708. Insert into a Sorted Circular Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-into-a-sorted-circular-linked-list/)

Given a node from a Circular Linked List which is sorted in ascending order, write a function to insert a value insertVal into the list such that it remains a sorted circular list. The given node can be a reference to any single node in the list, and may not be necessarily the smallest value in the circular list.

If there are multiple suitable places for insertion, you may choose any place to insert the new value. After the insertion, the circular list should remain sorted.

If the list is empty (i.e., given node is null), you should create a new single circular list and return the reference to that single node. Otherwise, you should return the original given node.

Example 1:

Input: head = [3,4,1], insertVal = 2
Output: [3,4,1,2]
Explanation: In the figure above, there is a sorted circular list of three elements. You are given a reference to the node with value 3, and we need to insert 2 into the list. The new node should be inserted between node 1 and node 3. After the insertion, the list should look like this, and we should still return node 3.

Example 2:

Input: head = [], insertVal = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The list is empty (given head is null). We create a new single circular list and return the reference to that single node.
Example 3:

Input: head = [1], insertVal = 0
Output: [1,0]

# Key insights
* Find the actual tail node by detecting where sorted order breaks (val > next.val)
* Insert at tail-head boundary if value is extreme (≤ tail or ≥ head)
* Otherwise traverse from head to find correct position maintaining sorted order
* Handle edge case of empty list by creating self-referencing single node

# Code
```javascript
var insert = function(head, insertVal) {
    if (head === null) {
        head = new Node(insertVal);
        head.next = head;
        return head;
    }

    var currNode = head;
    var newNode = new Node(insertVal);
    
    do {
        currNode = currNode.next;
    } while (currNode.val <= currNode.next.val && currNode !== head);
    
    const actualTail = currNode;
    currNode = currNode.next;
    const actualHead = currNode;
    
    if (actualHead.val >= insertVal || actualTail.val <= insertVal) {
        actualTail.next = newNode;
        newNode.next = actualHead;
    } else {
        while (currNode.next.val <= insertVal && currNode.next !== actualHead) {
            currNode = currNode.next;
        }
        const tmpNext = currNode.next;
        currNode.next = newNode;
        newNode.next = tmpNext;
    }
    return head;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - In the worst case, we traverse the entire circular linked list twice: once to find the tail/head boundary and once more to find the correct insertion position.
**Space:** O(1) - Only uses a constant amount of extra space for pointer variables and the new node, regardless of input size.
