# X of a Kind in a Deck of Cards
[914. X of a Kind in a Deck of Cards](https://leetcode.com/problems/x-of-a-kind-in-a-deck-of-cards/)

You are given an integer array deck where deck[i] represents the number written on the ith card.

# Key insights
- Count the frequency of each card number
- Find the GCD of all frequencies
- If GCD >= 2, we can partition the deck into groups of size GCD
- Each group will have cards of the same number

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} deck
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var hasGroupsSizeX = function(deck) {
    const freqMap = new Map();
    for (const card of deck) {
        freqMap.set(card, (freqMap.get(card) || 0) + 1);
    }
    
    let g;
    for (const [deck, count] of freqMap) {
        g = (g === undefined) ? count : gcd(g, count);
    }
    return g >= 2;
};

function gcd(x, y) {
    return x === 0 ? y : gcd(y % x, x)
}

```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n log C) - where C is maximum count, for GCD calculations
**Space:** O(n) - for the frequency map
