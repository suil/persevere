# Hamming Distance
[461. Hamming Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/)

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

# Key insights
- XOR of x and y produces a number where each set bit represents a position where x and y differ
- Count set bits by checking the least significant bit with `& 1` and right-shifting until zero

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} x
 * @param {number} y
 * @return {number}
 */
var hammingDistance = function(x, y) {
    let r = x ^ y;

    let count = 0;
    while (r > 0) {
        count += r & 1;
        r >>= 1
    }
    return count;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(1) -- at most 32 iterations for 32-bit integers
**Space:** O(1)
