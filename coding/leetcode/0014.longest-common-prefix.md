# Longest Common Prefix
[14. Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/)

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
 

Constraints:

1 <= strs.length <= 200
0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters if it is non-empty.

# Key insights

- **Horizontal scanning**: use the first string as reference, check each character position across all strings
- Iterate through each character index of the first string
- For each position, verify that all other strings have the same character at that position
- Stop immediately when any string doesn't match (or is too short)

# Code
```javascript
var longestCommonPrefix = function(strs) {
    const [first, ...rest] = strs;
    let prefix = '';

    for (let i = 0; i < first.length; i++) {
        const charInFirst = first[i];

        // all the rest has to have char
        const allHave = rest.every(str => str[i] === charInFirst);
        if (!allHave) {
            break;
        }
        prefix += charInFirst;
    }
    return prefix;
};
```
# Complexity

- **Time**: O(S) where S = sum of all characters in all strings. In worst case (all strings identical), we compare every character once.
- **Space**: O(1) excluding the output string
