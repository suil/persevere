# Max Consecutive Ones III
[1004. Max Consecutive Ones III](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/)

Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.

# Key insights
- Sliding window that expands right and shrinks left to maintain at most k zeros in the window
- Tracks the count of zeros in the current window; when it exceeds k, the left pointer advances to shrink the window
- The maximum window size seen during the traversal is the answer

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var longestOnes = function(nums, k) {
    let left = 0;
    let zeroCount = 0;
    let maxLen = 0;
    
    for (let right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
        if (nums[right] === 0) zeroCount++;

        while (left <= right && zeroCount > k) {
            if (nums[left] === 0) zeroCount--;
            left++;
        }

        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    return maxLen;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) -- each element is visited at most twice (once by right, once by left)
**Space:** O(1) -- only a few tracking variables
