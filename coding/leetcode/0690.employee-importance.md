# Employee Importance
[690. Employee Importance](https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-importance/)

You have a data structure of employee information, including the employee's unique ID, importance value, and direct subordinates' IDs.

# Key insights
- Build a map from employee ID to employee object for O(1) lookup during DFS
- DFS recursively sums the importance of the target employee and all subordinates in the hierarchy

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * Definition for Employee.
 * function Employee(id, importance, subordinates) {
 *     this.id = id;
 *     this.importance = importance;
 *     this.subordinates = subordinates;
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {Employee[]} employees
 * @param {number} id
 * @return {number}
 */
var GetImportance = function(employees, id) {
    const map = new Map();

    for (const employee of employees) {
        map.set(employee.id, employee);
    }

    function dfs(id) {
        if (!map.has(id)) return 0;

        const employee = map.get(id);

        let importance = employee.importance;

        for (const subordinateId of employee.subordinates || []) {
            importance += dfs(subordinateId) || 0;
        }
        return importance;
    }

    return dfs(id)
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) -- visits each employee at most once
**Space:** O(n) -- for the map and recursion stack
