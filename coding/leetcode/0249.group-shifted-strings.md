# Group Shifted Strings
[249. Group Shifted Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-shifted-strings/)

Given a string, we can "shift" each of its letter to its successive letter, for example: "abc" -> "bcd". We can keep "shifting" which forms the sequence:

"abc" -> "bcd" -> ... -> "xyz"
Given a list of strings which contains only lowercase alphabets, group all strings that belong to the same shifting sequence.

For example, given: ["abc", "bcd", "acef", "xyz", "az", "ba", "a", "z"], Return:

[
  ["abc","bcd","xyz"],
  ["az","ba"],
  ["acef"],
  ["a","z"]
]
Note: For the return value, each inner list's elements must follow the lexicographic order.

# Key insights
* Normalize strings by converting to relative character differences from first character
* Handle wraparound cases (z->a) by adding 26 to negative differences
* Use HashMap with normalized pattern as key to group equivalent shifted strings
* Convert difference arrays to comma-separated strings for unique grouping keys

# Code
```javascript
var groupStrings = function(strings) {
    const map = new Map();
    
    for (const string of strings) {
        const chars = string.split('');
        const normalizedCode = [];
        for (const char of chars) {
            let code = char.charCodeAt() - chars[0].charCodeAt();
            code = code >= 0 ? code : code + 26;
            normalizedCode.push(code);
        }
        const key = normalizedCode.join(',');
        if (!map.has(key)) { map.set(key, []); }
        map.get(key).push(string);
    }
    return [...map.values()];
};
