# Maximal Network Rank
[1615. Maximal Network Rank](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-network-rank/)

There is an infrastructure of n cities with some number of roads connecting these cities. Each roads[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities ai and bi.

# Key insights
- Network rank of two cities = sum of their degrees (number of roads)
- If the two cities are directly connected, subtract 1 (avoid double counting)
- Store connections in a Set for O(1) lookup
- Check all pairs to find maximum network rank

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} roads
 * @return {number}
 */
var maximalNetworkRank = function(n, roads) {
    const degree = Array(n).fill(0);
    const connected = new Set();

    for (const [a, b] of roads) {
        degree[a]++;
        degree[b]++;
        connected.add([a,b].join('-'));
        connected.add([b,a].join('-'));
    }

    let max = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            let rank = degree[i] + degree[j];
            if (connected.has([i, j].join('-'))) rank--;
            max = Math.max(max, rank);
        }
    }

    return max;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n^2) - checking all pairs of cities
**Space:** O(n + E) - for degree array and connection set
