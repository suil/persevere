# Fizz Buzz
[412. Fizz Buzz](https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/)

Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
answer[i] == i if non of the above conditions are true.

Example 1:
Input: n = 3
Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]

Example 2:
Input: n = 5
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]

Example 3:
Input: n = 15
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]

# Key insights
* Use modulo operator to check divisibility by 3 and 5
* String concatenation handles overlapping conditions (FizzBuzz)
* Logical OR operator provides fallback to number when string is empty
* Single pass linear iteration with O(n) time and space complexity

# Code
```javascript
var fizzBuzz = function(n) {
    var result = []
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        let output = '';
        if (i % 3 == 0) { output += 'Fizz'; }
        if (i % 5 == 0) { output += 'Buzz'; }
        result.push(output || `${i}`)
    }
    return result
};
```
