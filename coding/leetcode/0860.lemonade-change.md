# Lemonade Change
[860. Lemonade Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/lemonade-change/)

At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.

# Key insights
- Track count of $5 and $10 bills (don't need to track $20s - they can't be used as change)
- For $10: need one $5 as change
- For $20: prefer one $10 + one $5 over three $5s (greedy - preserve $5s which are more versatile)
- Return false if unable to give correct change

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} bills
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var lemonadeChange = function(bills) {
    let numOf5 = 0;
    let numOf10 = 0;
    let numOf20 = 0;

    for (const bill of bills) {
        if (bill === 5) {
            numOf5++;
        } else if (bill === 10) {
            if (numOf5 === 0) return false;
            numOf5--;
            numOf10++;
        } else if (bill === 20) {
            if (numOf5 > 0 && numOf10 > 0) { // greedy on picking 10 and 5 first
                numOf5--;
                numOf10--;
            } else if (numOf5 >= 3) {
                numOf5 -= 3;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - single pass through the bills
**Space:** O(1) - only tracking counts of two bill types
