# Reverse String
[344. Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

# Key insights
- Two pointers approach: one at start, one at end
- Swap characters at both pointers, then move pointers toward center
- Continue until pointers meet or cross

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {character[]} s
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
 */
var reverseString = function(s) {
    let left = 0, right = s.length - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        [s[left], s[right]] = [s[right], s[left]];
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return s;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - single pass through half the array
**Space:** O(1) - in-place swaps
