# Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
[124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/)

A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any path.

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.

Example 2:
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.

# Key insights
* Use post-order DFS to calculate maximum path sums from bottom up
* Track global maximum while returning best single-direction path for parent nodes
* Consider all path possibilities at each node: through left, right, or both children
* Separate concerns: return upward path sum vs track any possible maximum path

# Code
```javascript
var maxPathSum = function(root) {
    let max = -Infinity;
    
    function maxPathSumHelper(node) {
        if (node === null) { return 0; }
        
        const leftSum = maxPathSumHelper(node.left);
        const rightSum = maxPathSumHelper(node.right);
        
        const allPathSum = leftSum + rightSum + node.val;
        const leftPathSum = leftSum + node.val;
        const rightPathSum = rightSum + node.val;
        
        max = Math.max(max, node.val, allPathSum, leftPathSum, rightPathSum);
        return Math.max(node.val, leftPathSum, rightPathSum);
    }
    
    maxPathSumHelper(root);
    
    return max;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - visits each node exactly once in the binary tree where n is the number of nodes
**Space:** O(h) - uses recursion stack space proportional to the height h of the tree, which is O(log n) for balanced trees and O(n) for skewed trees
