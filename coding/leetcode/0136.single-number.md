# Single Number
[136. Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

# Key insights
- XOR all numbers together: x ^ x = 0 and x ^ 0 = x, so all pairs cancel out
- The remaining value after XORing all elements is the single number that appears once

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var singleNumber = function(nums) {
    let a = 0;
    for (const num of nums) {
      a ^= num;
    }
    return a;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n)
**Space:** O(1)
