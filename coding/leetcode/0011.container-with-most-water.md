# Container With Most Water
[11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Example 1:

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water the container can contain is 49.

Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1

Constraints:
n == height.length
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= height[i] <= 104

# Key insights
- Need to keep track of `Area = Min(h[L], h[R]) * (R - L)`. Global max is the solution
- `(R - L)` is always decreasing as pointers move inwards
- need to maximize the minimum. so move min is the only choice.
- Start with the widest possible container (left=0, right=n-1); moving pointers inward reduces width
- Water volume is limited by the shorter line, so moving the taller pointer inward can only make things worse
- Always move the pointer at the shorter line inward — it's the only way to potentially find a taller line that compensates for the reduced width

# Code
```javascript
var maxArea = function(height) {
    let left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
    let max = 0;
    while (left < right) {
        const water = Math.min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left);
        max = Math.max(max, water);
        if (height[left] < height[right]) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return max;
};
```

# Complexity
- Time: O(n) - single pass with two pointers
- Space: O(1)
