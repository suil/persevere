# Valid Parentheses
[20. Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "()"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
Example 4:

Input: s = "([)]"
Output: false
Example 5:

Input: s = "{[]}"
Output: true

# Key insights
* Stack data structure naturally handles LIFO matching of opening/closing brackets
* Hash map enables O(1) lookup to match closing brackets with their opening counterparts
* Single pass algorithm with early termination when mismatch is detected
* Final stack emptiness check ensures all opening brackets were properly closed

# Code
```javascript
var isValid = function(s) {
    const map = {
        '(': ')',
        '{': '}',
        '[': ']',
    };
    const stack = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        const char = s[i];
        if (char in map) {
            stack.push(i);
        } else {
            if (stack.length > 0 && map[s[stack.at(-1)]] === char) {
                stack.pop();
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }

    return stack.length === 0;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - Single pass through the string of length n, with constant time operations for each character
**Space:** O(n) - Stack can store up to n/2 opening brackets in worst case, plus constant space for the map
