# Campus Bikes
[1057. Campus Bikes](https://leetcode.com/problems/campus-bikes/)

On a campus represented on the X-Y plane, there are n workers and m bikes, with n <= m.

# Key insights
- Uses bucket sort by Manhattan distance: groups all (worker, bike) pairs by their distance
- Iterates through distance buckets in order, greedily assigning the first available worker-bike pair at each distance
- Bucket sort avoids O(n log n) comparison sort; distances are bounded by the grid dimensions

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} workers
 * @param {number[][]} bikes
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var assignBikes = function(workers, bikes) {
    const distanceMap = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < workers.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < bikes.length; j++) {
            const distance = Math.abs(workers[i][0] - bikes[j][0]) + Math.abs(workers[i][1] - bikes[j][1]);
            if (!distanceMap[distance]) {
                distanceMap[distance] = [];
            }
            
            distanceMap[distance].push([i, j]);
        }
    }
    
    
    const assignedWorkers = new Set();
    const takenBikes = new Set();
    const result = [];
    
    for (const distance of distanceMap) {
        if (!distance) {
            continue;
        }
        for (const [workerIndex, bikeIndex] of distance) {
            if (!assignedWorkers.has(workerIndex) && !takenBikes.has(bikeIndex)) {
                result[workerIndex] = bikeIndex;
                assignedWorkers.add(workerIndex);
                takenBikes.add(bikeIndex);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n * m) -- where n is the number of workers and m is the number of bikes
**Space:** O(n * m) -- for the distance buckets storing all pairs
