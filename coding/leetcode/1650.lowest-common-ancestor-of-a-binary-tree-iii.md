### Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III
[1650. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree-iii/)

```html
Given two nodes of a binary tree p and q, return their lowest common ancestor (LCA).

Each node will have a reference to its parent node. The definition for Node is below:

class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node parent;
}
According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes p and q in a tree T is the lowest node that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."

Example 1:
          __3__
         /     \
        5       1
       / \     / \
      6   2   0   8
         / \
        7   4
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

Example 2:
          __3__
         /     \
        5       1
       / \     / \
      6   2   0   8
         / \
        7   4
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5 since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

Example 3:
Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
Output: 1
```

using two pointers:
```javascript
var lowestCommonAncestor = function(p, q) {
    let nodeA = p;
    let nodeB = q; 
    while (nodeA !== nodeB) {
        nodeA = nodeA === null ? q : nodeA.parent;
        nodeB = nodeB === null ? p : nodeB.parent;        
    }
    return nodeA;
};
```

Set:
```javascript
var lowestCommonAncestor = function(p, q) {
    const set = new Set();
    while (p !== null) {
        set.add(p);
        p = p.parent;
    }
    while (q !== null) {
        if (set.has(q)) {
            return q;
        }
        q = q.parent;
    }
    return null;
};
```
