# Candy
[135. Candy](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/)

There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

# Key insights
- Two-pass greedy: left-to-right pass ensures each child with a higher rating than its left neighbor gets more candy
- Right-to-left pass ensures each child with a higher rating than its right neighbor gets more candy, taking the max of both passes
- Initialize everyone with 1 candy; sum the final array for the minimum total

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} ratings
 * @return {number}
 */
var candy = function(ratings) {
    const candies = Array(ratings.length).fill(1);

    for (let i = 1; i < ratings.length; i++) {
        if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {
            candies[i] = Math.max(candies[i], candies[i - 1] + 1);
        }
    }
    for (let i = ratings.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]) {
            candies[i] = Math.max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1);
        }
    }

    return candies.reduce((s, c) => s + c, 0);
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n)
**Space:** O(n) for the candies array
