# Meeting Rooms
[252. Meeting Rooms](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms/)

Given an array of meeting time intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], determine if a person could attend all meetings.

# Key insights
* Sort intervals by end time to process meetings in chronological order
* Single pass with greedy approach - track previous meeting's end time
* Check if current meeting starts after previous one ends to detect overlaps
* O(n log n) time due to sorting, O(1) space for the checking logic

# Code
```javascript
var canAttendMeetings = function(intervals) {
  if (intervals.length === 0) { return true; }
  
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);

  let prevEnd = intervals[0][1];

  for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
    const [currentStart, currentEnd] = intervals[i];
    if (currentStart >= prevEnd) { // no overlapping
      prevEnd = currentEnd;
    } else { // overlapping
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  return true;
};
