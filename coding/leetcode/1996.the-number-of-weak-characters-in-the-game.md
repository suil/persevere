# The Number of Weak Characters in the Game
[1996. The Number of Weak Characters in the Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-weak-characters-in-the-game/)

You are playing a game that contains multiple characters, and each of the characters has two main properties: attack and defense. You are given a 2D integer array properties where properties[i] = [attacki, defensei] represents the properties of the ith character in the game.

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} properties
 * @return {number}
 */
var numberOfWeakCharacters = function(properties) {
    properties.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0] || b[1] - a[1]);

    let count = 0;
    const stack = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < properties.length; i++) {
        const [attack, defence] = properties[i];
        while (stack.length > 0 && stack.at(-1) < defence) {
            stack.pop();
            count++;
        }
        stack.push(defence);
    }
    return count;
};
