# Path Sum
[112. Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/)

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.

A leaf is a node with no children.

Example 1:

              5
             / \
            4   8
           /   / \
          11  13  4
         /  \      \
        7    2      1

Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
Output: true

Example 2:
    1
   / \
  2   3
Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: root = [1,2], targetSum = 0
Output: false

# Key insights
* Use recursive DFS to traverse all root-to-leaf paths in the binary tree
* Subtract current node value from target sum to track remaining sum needed
* Base case checks if leaf node equals remaining target sum
* Short-circuit evaluation with OR operator stops search early when path found

# Code
```javascript
var hasPathSum = function(root, targetSum) {
    if (!root) { return false; }
    if (!root.left && !root.right && targetSum === root.val) {
        return true;
    }
    return hasPathSum(root.left, targetSum - root.val) || hasPathSum(root.right, targetSum - root.val);
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - visits each node in the binary tree exactly once in the worst case
**Space:** O(h) - uses recursion stack space proportional to the height of the tree, where h can be log n for balanced trees or n for skewed trees
