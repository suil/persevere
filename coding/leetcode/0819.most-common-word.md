# Most Common Word
[819. Most Common Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-common-word/)

Given a string paragraph and a string array of the banned words banned, return the most frequent word that is not banned. It is guaranteed there is at least one word that is not banned, and that the answer is unique.

# Key insights
- Split paragraph by non-word characters after lowercasing to extract clean words
- Count frequencies with a map while skipping banned words
- Track the max frequency word on-the-fly during the single pass

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} paragraph
 * @param {string[]} banned
 * @return {string}
 */
var mostCommonWord = function(paragraph, banned) {
    const words = paragraph.toLowerCase().split(/\W+/g).filter(Boolean);
    const map = new Map();

    let mostFreqWord = '';
    let maxFreq = -Infinity;
    for (const word of words) {
        if (banned.includes(word)) continue;
        map.set(word, (map.get(word) || 0) + 1);
        if (map.get(word) > maxFreq) {
            mostFreqWord = word;
            maxFreq = map.get(word);
        }
    }

    return mostFreqWord;
    
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n + b * w) where n is paragraph length, b is banned list length, w is number of words (banned.includes is O(b) per word)
**Space:** O(n) for the word list and frequency map
