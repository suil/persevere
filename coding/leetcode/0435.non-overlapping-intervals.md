# Non-overlapping Intervals
[435. Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)

Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

# Key insights
- Sort intervals by start time
- Greedy: when two intervals overlap, keep the one with smaller end time
- The interval with smaller end leaves more room for subsequent intervals
- Count the number of intervals removed due to overlap

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} intervals
 * @return {number}
 */
var eraseOverlapIntervals = function(intervals) {
    intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

    /* 
        [1, 2]
            2  3
               3 4
         1     3

         2,     6
            3     8
            3 5
    */ 
    let [, prevEnd] = intervals[0];
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
        const [start, end] = intervals[i];
        if (start < prevEnd) { // overlap
            prevEnd = Math.min(prevEnd, end);
            count++;
        } else {
            prevEnd = end;
        }
    }
    return count;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n log n) - dominated by sorting
**Space:** O(1) - only using variables (or O(log n) for sorting)
