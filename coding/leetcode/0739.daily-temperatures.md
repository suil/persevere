# Daily Temperatures
[739. Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)

Given a list of daily temperatures T, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.

For example, given the list of temperatures T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], your output should be [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0].

Note: The length of temperatures will be in the range [1, 30000]. Each temperature will be an integer in the range [30, 100].

# Key insights
* Use monotonic decreasing stack to track pending temperature indices
* Stack stores indices of temperatures waiting for warmer days
* Pop stack when current temperature is warmer than stack top temperatures
* Single pass O(n) solution instead of nested loops O(n²)

# Code
```javascript
var dailyTemperatures = function(T) {
    const stack = [];
    const res = [...Array(T.length)].fill(0);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < T.length; i++) {
        while (stack.length > 0 && T[i] > T[stack[stack.length - 1]]) {
            const index = stack.pop();
            res[index] = i - index;
        }
        stack.push(i);
    }
    return res;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - Each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once, resulting in linear time complexity.
**Space:** O(n) - The stack can store up to n indices in the worst case (decreasing temperature sequence), plus O(n) for the result array.
