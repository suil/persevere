# Strobogrammatic Number
[246. Strobogrammatic Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/strobogrammatic-number/)

A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).

Write a function to determine if a number is strobogrammatic. The number is represented as a string.

For example, the numbers "69", "88", and "818" are all strobogrammatic.

# Key insights
* Use hash map to store digit rotation mappings for O(1) lookup
* Two-pointer technique comparing characters from both ends simultaneously
* Single pass validation with early termination on mismatch
* Only digits 0,1,6,8,9 are valid when rotated 180 degrees

# Code
```javascript
var isStrobogrammatic = function(num) {
    let upsideDowns = {
        '1' : '1',
        '6' : '9',
        '8' : '8',
        '9' : '6',
        '0' : '0'
    }
    for (let i = 0, j = num.length -1; i < num.length; i++, j--){
        if (upsideDowns[num[i]] != num[j]) {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - iterates through the entire string once, where n is the length of the input string
**Space:** O(1) - uses a fixed-size hash map with 5 key-value pairs and constant extra variables
