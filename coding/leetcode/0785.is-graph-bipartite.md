# Is Graph Bipartite?
[785. Is Graph Bipartite?](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-graph-bipartite/description/)

Given an undirected graph, return true if and only if it is bipartite.

Recall that a graph is bipartite if we can split it’s set of nodes into two independent subsets A and B such that every edge in the graph has one node in A and another node in B.

The graph is given in the following form: graph[i] is a list of indexes j for which the edge between nodes i and j exists.  Each node is an integer between 0 and graph.length - 1.  There are no self edges or parallel edges: graph[i] does not contain i, and it doesn’t contain any element twice.

Example 1:
Input: [[1,3], [0,2], [1,3], [0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: 
The graph looks like this:
0----1
|    |
|    |
3----2
We can divide the vertices into two groups: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
Example 2:
Input: [[1,2,3], [0,2], [0,1,3], [0,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: 
The graph looks like this:
0----1
| \  |
|  \ |
3----2
We cannot find a way to divide the set of nodes into two independent subsets.

# Key insights
* Use graph coloring with DFS to check if nodes can be colored with two colors
* Handle disconnected components by iterating through all unvisited nodes
* Alternate colors between RED and BLUE when traversing to adjacent nodes
* Check color conflicts when revisiting already colored nodes

# Code
```javascript
const RED = 1;
const BLUE = 2;
var isBipartite = function(graph) {
    const visited = []
    for (let i = 0; i < graph.length; i++) {
        if (visited[i] === undefined && !isBipartiteHelper(graph, i, RED, visited)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
};
function isBipartiteHelper(graph, current, marker, visited) {
    if (visited[current] !== undefined) {
        return marker === visited[current];
    }
    visited[current] = marker;
    for (const neighbor of graph[current]) {
        const nextMarker = visited[current] === RED ? BLUE : RED;
        if (!isBipartiteHelper(graph, neighbor, nextMarker, visited)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(V + E) - visits each vertex once and traverses each edge once through DFS traversal of all connected components
**Space:** O(V) - uses visited array of size V plus recursive call stack that can go up to V deep in worst case
