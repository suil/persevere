# Bitwise AND of Numbers Range
[201. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range](https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-and-of-numbers-range/)

Given two integers left and right that represent the range [left, right], return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

# Key insights
- The bitwise AND of a range zeros out all bits that differ between left and right
- Right-shift both left and right until they are equal (finding the common prefix), then left-shift back
- The common prefix of the binary representations is the answer

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} left
 * @param {number} right
 * @return {number}
 */
var rangeBitwiseAnd = function(left, right) {
    let shift = 0;
    while (left < right) {
        left >>= 1;
        right >>= 1;
        shift++;
    }
    return left << shift;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(log n) where n is the value of right**Space:** O(1)
