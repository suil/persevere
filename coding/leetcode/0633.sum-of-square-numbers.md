# Sum of Square Numbers
[633. Sum of Square Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-square-numbers/)

Given a non-negative integer c, decide whether there're two integers a and b such that a2 + b2 = c.

# Key insights
* Two pointer technique with one starting at 0 and other at sqrt(c)
* Adjust pointers based on sum comparison: decrease right if too large, increase left if too small
* Avoid nested loops by using mathematical constraint that both squares ≤ c
* O(√c) time complexity by limiting search space to square root of target

# Code
```javascript
var judgeSquareSum = function(c) {
    let i = 0;
    let j = Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(c));
    while (i <= j) {
        const target = i * i + j * j;
        if (target === c) {
            return true;
        }
        if (target > c) {
            j--;
        } else {
            i++;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(√c) - The two pointers i and j can move at most √c steps in total, where i starts at 0 and j starts at √c.
**Space:** O(1) - Only uses a constant amount of extra variables regardless of input size.
