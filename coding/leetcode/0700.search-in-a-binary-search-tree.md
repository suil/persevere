# Search in a Binary Search Tree
[700. Search in a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-binary-search-tree/)

You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer val.

Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals val and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return null.

Example 1:

        4
      /   \
     2     7
    / \
   1   3

Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2
Output: [2,1,3]

Example 2:

        4
      /   \
     2     7
    / \
   1   3

Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
Output: []

# Key insights
* Leverage BST property: values less than root are left, greater are right
* Use recursive approach to traverse only one path down the tree
* Binary elimination reduces search space by half at each step
* Time complexity O(log n) average, O(h) where h is tree height

# Code
```javascript
var searchBST = function(root, val) {
    if (root === null) { return null; }
    if (root.val === val) { return root; }
    if (root.val > val) {
        return searchBST(root.left, val);
    }
    return searchBST(root.right, val)
};
