# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
[122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii)

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

# Key insights
* Dynamic programming with state tracking for buy/sell decisions
* Two arrays track maximum profit after buying vs selling at each day
* At each step, choose between holding current position or making transaction
* Final answer is maximum profit when ending in sell state

# Code
```javascript
var maxProfit = function(prices) {
    const len = prices.length;
    const maxProfitAfterBuy = Array(len - 1);
    const maxProfitAfterSell = Array(len - 1);
    maxProfitAfterBuy[0] = -prices[0];
    maxProfitAfterSell[0] = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i < len; i++) {
        maxProfitAfterBuy[i] = Math.max(
            maxProfitAfterBuy[i - 1], // hold
            maxProfitAfterSell[i - 1] - prices[i] // buy
        )
        maxProfitAfterSell[i] = Math.max(
            maxProfitAfterSell[i - 1], // hold
            maxProfitAfterBuy[i - 1] + prices[i] // sell
        )
    }

    return maxProfitAfterSell[len - 1];
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - Single loop through the prices array of length n, performing constant time operations at each step.
**Space:** O(n) - Two arrays of size n-1 are created to store the maximum profit states after buying and selling.
