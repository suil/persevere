# Copy List with Random Pointer
[138. Copy List with Random Pointer](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/)

A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.

Return a deep copy of the list.

The Linked List is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:

val: an integer representing Node.val
random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) where random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.
Example 1:


Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Example 2:


Input: head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
Output: [[1,1],[2,1]]
Example 3:


Input: head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
Output: [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
Example 4:

Input: head = []
Output: []
Explanation: Given linked list is empty (null pointer), so return null.

# Key insights
* Use HashMap to map original nodes to their copies for O(1) node lookup
* Two-pass approach: first pass creates nodes, second pass connects pointers
* Handle null pointers by pre-populating map with [null, null] entry
* O(n) time and space complexity - single traversal with linear storage

# Code
```javascript
var copyRandomList = function(head) {
    if (!head) { return null; }
    const map = new Map([[null, null]]);
    let current = head;
    
    while (current !== null) {
        map.set(current, new Node(current.val, null, null));
        current = current.next;
    }
    
    current = head;
    while (current !== null) {
        map.get(current).next = map.get(current.next);
        map.get(current).random = map.get(current.random);
        current = current.next;
    }
    return map.get(head);
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - Two passes through the linked list of n nodes, with constant time Map operations
**Space:** O(n) - Map stores n key-value pairs for each node in the original list
