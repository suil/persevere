# Find And Replace in String
[833. Find And Replace in String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-and-replace-in-string/)

You are given a 0-indexed string s that you must perform k replacement operations on. The replacement operations are given as three 0-indexed parallel arrays, indices, sources, and targets, all of length k.

# Key insights
- Sort replacement operations by index in descending order so later replacements don't shift indices of earlier ones
- For each operation, verify the source matches at the given index before replacing
- Use splice on a character array for in-place replacement

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {number[]} indices
 * @param {string[]} sources
 * @param {string[]} targets
 * @return {string}
 */
var findReplaceString = function(s, indices, sources, targets) {
     // Combine indices, sources, and targets into a single array of operations
    let operations = indices.map((index, i) => ({
        index: index,
        source: sources[i],
        target: targets[i]
    }));

    // Sort operations by index in descending order (to avoid index shifting)
    operations.sort((a, b) => b.index - a.index);

    // Convert the string to an array for easier manipulation
    let result = s.split("");

    // Process each operation
    for (let op of operations) {
        let { index, source, target } = op;

        // Check if the source matches the substring at the given index
        if (s.slice(index, index + source.length) === source) {
            // Replace the substring
            result.splice(index, source.length, ...target.split(""));
        }
    }

    return result.join("");
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(k log k + k * L + n) where k is the number of operations, L is average source/target length, n is string length**Space:** O(n) for the result character array
