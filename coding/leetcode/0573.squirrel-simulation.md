# Squirrel Simulation
[573. Squirrel Simulation](https://leetcode.com/problems/squirrel-simulation/)

You are given two integers height and width representing a garden of size height x width. You are also given:

# Key insights
- Every nut requires a round trip (2 * distance to tree) except the first nut the squirrel collects, which uses squirrel-to-nut + nut-to-tree
- The optimal first nut maximizes (nutToTree - squirrelToNut), giving the largest savings over the default round trip
- Subtract this maximum saving from the total round-trip distance to get the minimum total distance

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} height
 * @param {number} width
 * @param {number[]} tree
 * @param {number[]} squirrel
 * @param {number[][]} nuts
 * @return {number}
 */
var minDistance = function(height, width, tree, squirrel, nuts) {
    // Calculate total twice the distance from nuts to the tree
    let total = 0;
    let maxDiff = -Infinity;
    for (let nut of nuts) {
        const nutToTree = Math.abs(nut[0] - tree[0]) + Math.abs(nut[1] - tree[1]);
        const squirrelToNut = Math.abs(nut[0] - squirrel[0]) + Math.abs(nut[1] - squirrel[1]);
        total += 2 * nutToTree;
        // Find the nut where (nutToTree - squirrelToNut) is maximized (which minimizes total distance)
        maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, nutToTree - squirrelToNut);
    }
    // Subtract the largest possible saving by picking the best nut first
    return total - maxDiff;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) where n is the number of nuts -- single pass to compute distances
**Space:** O(1)
