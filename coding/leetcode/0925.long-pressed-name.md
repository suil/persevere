# Long Pressed Name
[925. Long Pressed Name](https://leetcode.com/problems/long-pressed-name/)

Your friend is typing his name into a keyboard. Sometimes, when typing a character c, the key might get long pressed, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.

# Key insights
- Two pointers: one for name, one for typed
- Each typed character must either match the current name character or be a repeat of the previous
- If character doesn't match and isn't a repeat, return false
- At the end, verify that the entire name has been consumed

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} name
 * @param {string} typed
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isLongPressedName = function(name, typed) {
    if (name[0] !== typed[0]) return false;
    if (name.length > typed.length) return false;

    let pName = 0;
    for (let pTyped = 0; pTyped < typed.length; pTyped++) {
        if (name[pName] !== typed[pTyped]) {
            if (typed[pTyped] !== name[pName - 1]) {
                return false;
            }
        } else {
            pName++;
        }
    }
    return pName === name.length;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - where n is length of typed string
**Space:** O(1) - only using pointers
