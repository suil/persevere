# Isomorphic Strings
[205. Isomorphic Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/)

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true

# Key insights
* Use two hash maps to track character mappings bidirectionally
* Store indices as values to detect when mappings become inconsistent
* Single pass comparison of mapping patterns between strings
* Bidirectional mapping ensures one-to-one character correspondence

# Code
```javascript
var isIsomorphic = function(s, t) {
    if (!s || !t || s.length != t.length) {
        return false;
    }
    
    const mapS = new Map();
    const mapT = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (mapS.get(s[i]) !== mapT.get(t[i])) {
            return false;
        }
        mapS.set(s[i], i);
        mapT.set(t[i], i);
    }
    return true;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - Single pass through both strings of length n, with constant time Map operations for get/set at each position.
**Space:** O(k) - Two Maps store at most k unique characters from the strings, where k ≤ min(alphabet size, n).
