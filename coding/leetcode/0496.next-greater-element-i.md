# Next Greater Element I
[496. Next Greater Element I](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/)

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 both of unique elements, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2.

The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2. If it does not exist, return -1 for this number.

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation:
For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation:
For number 2 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
For number 4 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.

# Key insights
* Use monotonic stack to find next greater elements in O(n) time
* HashMap stores element-to-next-greater mappings for O(1) query lookup
* Stack maintains decreasing elements, popping when greater element found
* Two-pass approach: build map from nums2, then query for nums1 results

# Code
```javascript
var nextGreaterElement = function(nums1, nums2) {
    const stack = [];
    const map = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < nums2.length; i++) {
        while (stack.length > 0 && nums2[i] > stack[stack.length - 1]) {
            const lastNum = stack.pop();
            map.set(lastNum, nums2[i]);
        }
        stack.push(nums2[i]);
    }
    return nums1.map(num => map.has(num) ? map.get(num) : -1);
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n + m) - where n is length of nums2 and m is length of nums1; each element in nums2 is pushed/popped from stack at most once, plus mapping over nums1
**Space:** O(n) - stack and map can store at most n elements where n is length of nums2
