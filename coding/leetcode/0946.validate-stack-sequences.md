# Validate Stack Sequences
[946. Validate Stack Sequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-stack-sequences/)

Given two integer arrays pushed and popped each with distinct values, return true if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack, or false otherwise.

# Key insights
- Simulate the push/pop operations with an actual stack
- Push each element from 'pushed' array
- After each push, pop while stack top matches next element to pop
- Valid if all elements are successfully popped at the end

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} pushed
 * @param {number[]} popped
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var validateStackSequences = function(pushed, popped) {
    const stack = [];
    const len = pushed.length;
    
    let j = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < pushed.length; i++) {
        stack.push(pushed[i]);
        while (popped.length > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] === popped[0]) {
            popped.shift();
            stack.pop();
            j++;
        }
    }

    return j === len;
};
```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n) - each element is pushed and popped at most once
**Space:** O(n) - for the simulation stack
