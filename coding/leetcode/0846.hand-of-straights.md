# Hand of Straights
[846. Hand of Straights](https://leetcode.com/problems/hand-of-straights/)

Alice has some number of cards and she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size groupSize, and consists of groupSize consecutive cards.

# Key insights
- Sort unique card values and use a frequency map to greedily form consecutive groups starting from the smallest available card
- For each group, check that W consecutive values exist starting from the current smallest
- Remove cards from the frequency map as they are used; remove keys when count reaches zero

# Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} hand
 * @param {number} W
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isNStraightHand = function(hand, W) {
    const freqMap = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < hand.length; i++) {
        freqMap.set(hand[i], (freqMap.get(hand[i]) || 0) + 1);
    }
    
    const freqMapKeys = [...freqMap.keys()].sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    while (freqMapKeys.length > 0) {
        const firstKey = freqMapKeys[0];
        for (let i = firstKey; i < firstKey + W; i++) {
            if (!freqMapKeys.includes(i)) {
                return false;
            }
            
            const count = freqMap.get(i);
            if (count === 1) {
                freqMapKeys.shift();
            } else {
                freqMap.set(i, count - 1);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return true;
};

```

# Complexity
**Time:** O(n log n + n * W) where n is the number of cards (sorting + group formation with includes check)**Space:** O(n) for the frequency map and sorted keys
