### Friends Of Appropriate Ages
[825. Friends Of Appropriate Ages](https://leetcode.com/problems/friends-of-appropriate-ages/)
```html
Some people will make friend requests. The list of their ages is given and ages[i] is the age of the ith person. 

Person A will NOT friend request person B (B != A) if any of the following conditions are true:

age[B] <= 0.5 * age[A] + 7
age[B] > age[A]
age[B] > 100 && age[A] < 100
Otherwise, A will friend request B.

Note that if A requests B, B does not necessarily request A.  Also, people will not friend request themselves.

How many total friend requests are made?

Example 1:

Input: [16,16]
Output: 2
Explanation: 2 people friend request each other.
Example 2:

Input: [16,17,18]
Output: 2
Explanation: Friend requests are made 17 -> 16, 18 -> 17.
Example 3:

Input: [20,30,100,110,120]
Output: 3
Explanation: Friend requests are made 110 -> 100, 120 -> 110, 120 -> 100.
```

```javascript
var numFriendRequests = function(ages) {
    const counts = Array(121).fill(0);
    const accum = Array(121).fill(0);
    
    for (const age of ages) { ++counts[age]; }
    for (let i = 1; i <= 120; ++i) {
        accum[i] = accum[i - 1] + counts[i];
    }
    let ans = 0;
    for (let i = 15; i <= 120; ++i) {
        const base = accum[i - 1] - accum[Math.floor(i / 2 + 7)];
        ans += base * counts[i] + counts[i] * (counts[i] - 1);
    }
    return ans;
};

### Fizz Buzz
[412. Fizz Buzz](https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/)

```html
Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
answer[i] == i if non of the above conditions are true.

Example 1:
Input: n = 3
Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]

Example 2:
Input: n = 5
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]

Example 3:
Input: n = 15
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]
```

```javascript
var fizzBuzz = function(n) {
    var result = []
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        let output = '';
        if (i % 3 == 0) { output += 'Fizz'; }
        if (i % 5 == 0) { output += 'Buzz'; }
        result.push(output || `${i}`)
    }
    return result
};
```
